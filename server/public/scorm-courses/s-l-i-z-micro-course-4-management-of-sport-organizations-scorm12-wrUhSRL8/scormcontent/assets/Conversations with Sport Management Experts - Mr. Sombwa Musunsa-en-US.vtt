15c02da7-f101-4bd3-8095-ec60d58cda97-0
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.680
Just by curiosity.

0789f525-df58-4f05-81f1-f1408f2626ea-0
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.760
So you said that you did your training in
Cuba.

69b5914a-2244-49d8-88b5-206187099083-0
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.480
So are you fluent in Spanish?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.020
How, how did the language become,
you know, a matter of, you know, I would,

0d9a2f2f-d320-4611-ac33-695280c0ab98-1
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.440
I would.

83e11900-bb11-46dd-8945-db18d9d33931-0
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.040
I wouldn't care.

c9cbb9fc-6497-46bb-8548-e569c911e588-0
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.920

04e71c98-d5c6-4acc-96bd-47b558a747e6-0
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.360
You must be fluent in Spanish.

018454db-acf8-489a-b8fb-687d6ea459e0-0
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.000
But I do speak.

cb63484b-1ab2-4cd8-8cd0-e1050b8d2121-0
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.838

cb63484b-1ab2-4cd8-8cd0-e1050b8d2121-1
00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.840
because I don't have so many people to
practice with.

d8a7ea21-2978-4558-9ecc-6471f607d570-0
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.875
But when we're in Cuba,
we had a lot of people or colleagues

d8a7ea21-2978-4558-9ecc-6471f607d570-1
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:39.514
coming from different continents,
especially South America, Central America,

d8a7ea21-2978-4558-9ecc-6471f607d570-2

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.400
We did have some from the United States.

2c9ceff2-474d-4c15-bc9f-39b4bcaba42b-0
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.657
The African were quite a number of
African countries represented in Cuba and

2c9ceff2-474d-4c15-bc9f-39b4bcaba42b-1
00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:54.800

So there was nothing else the other
language that you could use in class

936c3a8d-b239-4cd2-82ad-44d50a1bd2e2-1
00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.520
other than Spanish from day one.

aa445841-bccc-483f-b4ba-44a5aa494b76-0

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.080
I was curious about when you were
mentioned.

You know,

97d327f9-2712-44aa-bdb5-e6f11b7be852-1
00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.040
major thing, you know, language.

5606b7f1-fff9-4f9b-b846-28df58fc4341-0
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.240
Yeah.

2d0201da-56f8-4f08-a060-0e3e67f52250-0

Yeah.

6ce7f176-3f5b-45cb-b03a-86f545fdc924-0
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.311

Zambia in general first, you know,
so for those less familiar with what's,

6ce7f176-3f5b-45cb-b03a-86f545fdc924-2

basically of the sport landscape in
Zambia?

ea62c2c3-db0b-4a59-8ce1-30a9647d468f-0
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.308
You know, in terms of, you know,
how it is organized very briefly,

ea62c2c3-db0b-4a59-8ce1-30a9647d468f-1
00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:39.605
you know,
but also and what has been some of the

ea62c2c3-db0b-4a59-8ce1-30a9647d468f-2
00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:44.046
major countries, you know,
achievements in terms of international

ea62c2c3-db0b-4a59-8ce1-30a9647d468f-3
00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:46.200
sports, You know the words, why?

44078343-c5d8-440e-a57a-02be0d46dd6e-0
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.108
Who are those, you know,
national heroes in terms of sports in

44078343-c5d8-440e-a57a-02be0d46dd6e-1
00:05:50.108 --> 00:05:50.520
Zambia?

b2678dc4-f2d3-4f02-86bb-2cb7c69b5ef1-0
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.440
Indeed.

50fddcf7-11dd-45a7-a374-60712390d63a-0
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.367
So when you look at the Zambia sports
development sector in general,

50fddcf7-11dd-45a7-a374-60712390d63a-1
00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:01.200
it's similar to most of the African
countries that we have.

3a47d954-6312-4968-b1ae-2ed513da9d2f-0
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.502
It's basically managed or hugely managed
by the government and then this is

3a47d954-6312-4968-b1ae-2ed513da9d2f-1
00:06:06.502 --> 00:06:10.600
represented by the ministry in charge of
sport and recreation.

34084933-9af7-48a5-bae1-af0282dcf3a9-0
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.341
So in Zambia,
we have the Ministry of Youth,

34084933-9af7-48a5-bae1-af0282dcf3a9-1
00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:20.140
Sport and Arts that presides over most of
the sport development programs in the

34084933-9af7-48a5-bae1-af0282dcf3a9-2
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.720
country.

9dcf8db5-e676-4e7a-abf7-9bb48ef33b0b-0
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.568
But under the Ministry of Sport,
which has got the Department of Sport,

9dcf8db5-e676-4e7a-abf7-9bb48ef33b0b-1
00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:33.448
we have the National Sports Council of
Zambia, which is coordination,

9dcf8db5-e676-4e7a-abf7-9bb48ef33b0b-2
00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:39.160
registration of national federations,
you know, across the country.

4d19d108-af3a-4624-9f7b-ede0f33d757b-0
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.716
So we have about 60 national federations
that are affiliated to the National

4d19d108-af3a-4624-9f7b-ede0f33d757b-1
00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:46.520
Sports Council of Zambia.

ece9394e-9ccc-4511-a18f-4eb46f50c42c-0
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.097
But we do work closely with other sports
organizations like the National Olympic

ece9394e-9ccc-4511-a18f-4eb46f50c42c-1
00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:57.298
Committee of Zambia that is in charge of
participation of Zambian athletes in the

ece9394e-9ccc-4511-a18f-4eb46f50c42c-2
00:06:57.298 --> 00:07:00.596
Olympic Games,
Commonwealth Games and other related

ece9394e-9ccc-4511-a18f-4eb46f50c42c-3
00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:01.040
events.

5438e524-8592-4f4f-988b-83bb2187b5bb-0
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.704
We do have the National Paralympic
Committee of Zambia in charge of

5438e524-8592-4f4f-988b-83bb2187b5bb-1
00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:10.520
participation of Zambian athletes in
Paralympic Games and related events.

4f7111fa-07ae-4c21-8276-3095ff950808-0
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.640
We do also have new organizations like
Special Olympics of Zambia.

f3262177-eba8-475b-a3a8-a7118735d004-0
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.052
We do work we sport for social change Ng
OS like Sporting Action Asia,

f3262177-eba8-475b-a3a8-a7118735d004-1
00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:25.680
Sport N Spa and a few other organizations
that are spread across the country.

2ec040c7-53ec-4c5e-bbd3-e5a5b70b77f6-0
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.148
On the other hand,
we do work under the same umbrella in

2ec040c7-53ec-4c5e-bbd3-e5a5b70b77f6-1
00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:31.040
terms of sport.

8008ba6a-ad7f-4ee8-be6b-0a46ea6ec7e0-0
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.152
We work closely with the Ministry of
Education in promoting physical education

8008ba6a-ad7f-4ee8-be6b-0a46ea6ec7e0-1
00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:36.800
and sport.

5e87f992-460a-46c9-beea-35a5d5610204-0
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.168
And we have a few other organizations
that are also affiliated to the Ministry

5e87f992-460a-46c9-beea-35a5d5610204-1
00:07:41.168 --> 00:07:43.680
of Education that we consider to be
stakeholders.

217c20c8-fd47-48e7-9d08-eb2464ab57e1-0
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.297
So this is the the sporting landscape in
Zambia is obviously derived from the

217c20c8-fd47-48e7-9d08-eb2464ab57e1-1
00:07:49.297 --> 00:07:51.800
British system in terms of management.

91c841dc-7888-48ab-b827-79399a2bd397-0
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.320
I know the British system has evolved
over the years.

b51d9f71-ee93-4d2d-b917-1757e5899233-0
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.693
Britain was aware our colonizers and so
we did adopt some of their systems,

b51d9f71-ee93-4d2d-b917-1757e5899233-1
00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:04.320
including how we manage sport.

2b2ea173-cafb-42fe-8395-cac255a858ab-0
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.501
But when you look at the bit of history
in terms of sport, it was brought,

2b2ea173-cafb-42fe-8395-cac255a858ab-1
00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:12.291
the organized sport was brought or
contemporary sport was brought to Zambia

2b2ea173-cafb-42fe-8395-cac255a858ab-2
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.040
by the British.

526e92b5-cb14-4c8d-a68c-4fe3bf39a412-0
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.506
And some of the popular sports we have
football which is called soccer in in the

526e92b5-cb14-4c8d-a68c-4fe3bf39a412-1
00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:19.320
United States.

268ed569-812e-468c-b27e-06e3d28b83e4-0
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.786
And then you have netball,
you have cricket and a few other sport

268ed569-812e-468c-b27e-06e3d28b83e4-1
00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:24.160
balls.

c4ef4504-1b5f-483c-b4da-068d63d8d8ef-0
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.570
And it was largely centered around what
we call the copper belt where we produce

c4ef4504-1b5f-483c-b4da-068d63d8d8ef-1
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.560
a lot of copper.

f9807107-56df-4baf-9878-6b79865428c6-0
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.720
My induce amber is one of the largest
copper producing countries in the world.

c32a2b7b-ad4c-4d0f-8553-75b647484666-0
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.978
And so we had the number of Europeans in
on that,

c32a2b7b-ad4c-4d0f-8553-75b647484666-1
00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:43.579
that where mining copper or involved in
mining activities,

c32a2b7b-ad4c-4d0f-8553-75b647484666-2
00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:48.960
but also in the free time they would
participate in organized sport.

ed1ddaa4-aecd-4d51-b607-e68562e51634-0
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.675
Further the natives that is the Zambian's
now even before we got independence in

ed1ddaa4-aecd-4d51-b607-e68562e51634-1
00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:59.598
1964, we are also involved in football,
mostly in football and a few other

ed1ddaa4-aecd-4d51-b607-e68562e51634-2
00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:00.320
activities.

af238b85-4942-44c3-a611-26cf568e7872-0
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.199
So you'll find that sport was more
developed in this region and then started

af238b85-4942-44c3-a611-26cf568e7872-1
00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:06.840
spreading to other regions.

36dad0de-e4b7-48fb-a550-12edb2bc0331-0
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.560
And this is where we are.

b9fe136c-cf3e-483e-b182-fc5de28e6e12-0
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.709
And when you look at the copper belt,
it's the cradle of sport development in

b9fe136c-cf3e-483e-b182-fc5de28e6e12-1
00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:14.440
the country.

206626a0-8553-4fd1-bdd6-d1ab0acd6abd-0
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.785
That's where you get most of the talented
athletes this country has ever produced,

206626a0-8553-4fd1-bdd6-d1ab0acd6abd-1
00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:21.200
especially in football.

cfa70a4f-9f75-4978-b130-38c9ee0acb11-0
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.480
Obviously the tide has changed.

b7721c59-5073-402a-841c-859a3a2bad04-0
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.530
We have got a few that are coming from
where we are in the in Zambia in terms of

b7721c59-5073-402a-841c-859a3a2bad04-1
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.271
the capital city,
we have got some that are coming from the

b7721c59-5073-402a-841c-859a3a2bad04-2
00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:34.080
southern and other provinces.

f4e037d6-ebe3-4211-8f19-683e12411aac-0
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.599
So when you look at the some of Zambia's
icons, most of them the old ones,

f4e037d6-ebe3-4211-8f19-683e12411aac-1
00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:41.600
they come from the copper belt.

a450b99a-a48a-4c86-933c-356cbc2d12e6-0
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.229
You're talking about Kamusha Waria,
who was part of the national team for

a450b99a-a48a-4c86-933c-356cbc2d12e6-1
00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:49.991
football and also voted as the 1988
African Player of the Year,

a450b99a-a48a-4c86-933c-356cbc2d12e6-2
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:51.520
came from the copper belt.

82dbe2c2-eb0b-4ae9-9d35-e18a4e6de23e-0
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.941
When you look at Samuel Mateteo,
who is who,

82dbe2c2-eb0b-4ae9-9d35-e18a4e6de23e-1
00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:59.974
who gave us the a silver medal,
is the first silver medal at the Olympic,

82dbe2c2-eb0b-4ae9-9d35-e18a4e6de23e-2
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:03.920
which were in Atlanta in 1996,
came from the copper belt.

3fb37222-a64d-4361-838b-8b188d689326-0
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.162
And if you look at Keith Miller,
who was the first Zambian to ever win a

3fb37222-a64d-4361-838b-8b188d689326-1
00:10:10.162 --> 00:10:16.000
medal in the 1970s in the in the Olympic
Games, came from the copper belt.

f91f4e01-bccc-431e-aa25-951f78756b0f-0
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.544
So you have got a number of icons that
have made from the copper belt but we

f91f4e01-bccc-431e-aa25-951f78756b0f-1
00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:27.219
have got new ones like Zalasam Konga who
is one of is is is the fourth fastest 400

f91f4e01-bccc-431e-aa25-951f78756b0f-2
00:10:27.219 --> 00:10:31.800
meter athletes in the world and also gave
us the set Zambia medal,

f91f4e01-bccc-431e-aa25-951f78756b0f-3
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.920
a bronze medal in the Olympics.

33e980b0-4a84-42aa-b2f3-f1012c8adad8-0
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.271
So we have had a number of icons in terms
of individuals but also we have had teams

33e980b0-4a84-42aa-b2f3-f1012c8adad8-1
00:10:40.271 --> 00:10:45.800
like the Zambia National Football team
that won the African Cup in the 2012.

d1faa39c-49d1-4ee3-852f-9fa7cb467361-0
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.320
That was the first time that Zambia ever
won an African Cup in football.

4cc0cb98-51d4-4495-9cc1-10998e254336-0
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.422
But we have other teams, other sports,
sports that also have athletes that have

4cc0cb98-51d4-4495-9cc1-10998e254336-1
00:10:59.422 --> 00:11:02.886
become icons,
most of them coming from athletics,

4cc0cb98-51d4-4495-9cc1-10998e254336-2
00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:06.697
boxing, judo,
football itself and the few from netball

4cc0cb98-51d4-4495-9cc1-10998e254336-3
00:11:06.697 --> 00:11:08.360
and other sports boards.

335910ca-538a-444b-9394-fe5a46669117-0
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.262
No, that's that's an incredible,
you know what you talk about the history

335910ca-538a-444b-9394-fe5a46669117-1
00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:19.298
in terms of, you know, the in being like,
you know,

335910ca-538a-444b-9394-fe5a46669117-2
00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:22.480
adopting like the British systems, right.

dd9721eb-5fde-4bbf-97eb-f5ceab8eae19-0
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.246
And another interesting point that you
mentioned about, you know,

dd9721eb-5fde-4bbf-97eb-f5ceab8eae19-1
00:11:27.246 --> 00:11:30.045
the copper belt, you know,
and I was very listening,

dd9721eb-5fde-4bbf-97eb-f5ceab8eae19-2
00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:34.165
very careful about that because you know,
I come from a country which is also

dd9721eb-5fde-4bbf-97eb-f5ceab8eae19-3
00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:36.120
copper is the major industry as well.

05ccc609-dbf2-45e7-8564-51716c6fcf0a-0
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.016
So,
so it is really interesting to see those

05ccc609-dbf2-45e7-8564-51716c6fcf0a-1
00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:39.880
commonalities.

f810495b-8348-4cf2-959e-3e2a2ba167fd-0
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.585
But,
but let me let's talk about now in terms

f810495b-8348-4cf2-959e-3e2a2ba167fd-1
00:11:42.585 --> 00:11:45.291
of the challenges, OK,
So not only in Zambia,

f810495b-8348-4cf2-959e-3e2a2ba167fd-2
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:48.820
but let's say across the continent,
you know, in your view,

f810495b-8348-4cf2-959e-3e2a2ba167fd-3
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.290
what are some of the main challenges
currently affecting the development of

f810495b-8348-4cf2-959e-3e2a2ba167fd-4
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.760
supporting Zambia and how is the National
Sport Council working to address?

720a26ee-c080-4a56-9a60-6bc866f001ed-0
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.307
So when we are looking at challenges,
we focus on the, you know,

720a26ee-c080-4a56-9a60-6bc866f001ed-1
00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:08.840
elements of national and international
sporting success.

a62d236d-951d-4f22-8b05-a2dd73afea95-0
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.880
So we're talking about infrastructure
capacity development for coaches and

a62d236d-951d-4f22-8b05-a2dd73afea95-1
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.120
other players in sport.

d00d2568-3df4-4c8e-b37a-0d7315fbf6f0-0
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.360
We're talking about sports science and
sport medicine.

7c4474f4-8e2a-4928-8073-47061b00814a-0
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.208
We're talking about athlete welfare and
education and the other elements that

7c4474f4-8e2a-4928-8073-47061b00814a-1
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:25.000
have to do with national and
international sporting success.

d7373680-2b92-4de4-b3c2-422ace568d5c-0
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.479
So when you look at the infrastructure,
we have inadequate international standard

d7373680-2b92-4de4-b3c2-422ace568d5c-1
00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:30.240
infrastructure.

8c1e033a-2117-4ad1-9295-013c2f4357a1-0
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.552
Currently,
we have got 2 stadium that can host

8c1e033a-2117-4ad1-9295-013c2f4357a1-1
00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:34.800
international events.

04e1d38c-d725-4fe6-8db6-e7c1956bc956-0
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.982
Obviously,
one of them still has challenges,

04e1d38c-d725-4fe6-8db6-e7c1956bc956-1
00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:42.311
but we we have one that can adequately
host the international events,

04e1d38c-d725-4fe6-8db6-e7c1956bc956-2
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:44.600
especially when it comes to football.

19ca9f93-cae5-431c-a916-b789760a6461-0
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.400
We do use it also for athletics.

d229393e-2ef7-4bb8-8eb4-37caf0367d2c-0
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.110
So infrastructure development is still
something that we need to look at in

d229393e-2ef7-4bb8-8eb4-37caf0367d2c-1
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:57.673
terms of making sure that we get rid of
some of the challenges that have to do

d229393e-2ef7-4bb8-8eb4-37caf0367d2c-2
00:12:57.673 --> 00:13:02.320
with accessibility to a high level
infrastructure in the country.

a95534ec-72f9-47a6-b48e-73cad92e715d-0
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.445
The second one is capacity development of
coaches,

a95534ec-72f9-47a6-b48e-73cad92e715d-1
00:13:06.445 --> 00:13:11.120
sport administrators and others that
support the sports sector.

5633858a-ea40-4bad-adca-0c60741a5399-0
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.268
So we need to reach a critical mass in
terms of the number of coaches that we

5633858a-ea40-4bad-adca-0c60741a5399-1
00:13:16.268 --> 00:13:19.974
are training or we have coaches that are
able to train our athletes,

5633858a-ea40-4bad-adca-0c60741a5399-2
00:13:19.974 --> 00:13:23.680
advocate to train our athletes at the
highest level of the sporting.

3c8d2995-22a1-40b5-9bb8-4d7a57a93a7a-0
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.481
So we don't have in office when it comes
to athletics,

3c8d2995-22a1-40b5-9bb8-4d7a57a93a7a-1
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:31.454
we have basically one course that can be
able to take athletes to the Olympic

3c8d2995-22a1-40b5-9bb8-4d7a57a93a7a-2
00:13:31.454 --> 00:13:31.760
Games.

caf96f07-896a-416b-a686-27e9e05ac48a-0
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.127
When you look at boxing,
we have one course that can be able to

caf96f07-896a-416b-a686-27e9e05ac48a-1
00:13:35.127 --> 00:13:36.760
take boxers to the Olympic Games.

ff97dec3-f6a9-4c77-b970-4f84dfcf404b-0
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.320
But this is this is not the way things
should be.

9f9f3705-37f6-49df-abe3-c240f76ad8e7-0
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.720
So we need more coaches in sports science.

afea8b98-ba88-44cd-ae34-8bfd0ed6f4f6-0
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.200
It's something that is the sector that we
have neglected as a country.

04eb1d14-4ffe-4df9-9e7a-db9dfd6a47a0-0
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.752
Whilst other countries like Boswana and
South Africa advancing in terms of

04eb1d14-4ffe-4df9-9e7a-db9dfd6a47a0-1
00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:53.608
investment in sports science,
we are still using traditional ways of

04eb1d14-4ffe-4df9-9e7a-db9dfd6a47a0-2
00:13:53.608 --> 00:13:57.968
identifying talent but also ensuring that
our athletes perform to the optimum

04eb1d14-4ffe-4df9-9e7a-db9dfd6a47a0-3
00:13:57.968 --> 00:13:58.360
levels.

32e6836b-619a-4b8f-9318-baeeb94b85ea-0
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.976
So we need we we don't have a structured
way of administering sports science and

32e6836b-619a-4b8f-9318-baeeb94b85ea-1
00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:05.960
sport medicine when it comes to attending
to our athletes.

2861e95b-e359-4c1b-9f2f-48923f422bb0-0
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.765
We don't even have specialized clinics or
hospitals that deal with sport medicine

2861e95b-e359-4c1b-9f2f-48923f422bb0-1
00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:13.040
or sports science.

2b00f47b-e383-4199-8af7-6186bbd59313-0
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.920
When it comes to financing,
that is the one of the biggest challenges.

89be01ba-3b20-409a-9818-dc910f4ba2d5-0
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.594
Sporting in Zambia is one of the least
funded sectors and that in itself

89be01ba-3b20-409a-9818-dc910f4ba2d5-1
00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:24.720
compounds the rest of the challenges that
we have.

b07ca3af-f499-47a1-bcf3-eb259c0332d8-0
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.148
And so we need to address the issue of
structured,

b07ca3af-f499-47a1-bcf3-eb259c0332d8-1
00:14:28.148 --> 00:14:32.120
structured and structured approach in
terms of how we find sport.

ae787975-d4eb-4434-9fbe-55bc37387215-0
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.892
We need to look at how we can be able to
come up with a system which is lacking at

ae787975-d4eb-4434-9fbe-55bc37387215-1
00:14:37.892 --> 00:14:41.797
the moment in terms of how we find high
performance sport,

ae787975-d4eb-4434-9fbe-55bc37387215-2
00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:46.165
How do we find grassroots sport,
who are our partners in terms of

ae787975-d4eb-4434-9fbe-55bc37387215-3
00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:48.680
providing adequate financing to sport?

29142f68-2f7b-4370-a38d-07ab8a9c94b2-0
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.953
We also have challenges in terms of
appreciation of partners in terms of the

29142f68-2f7b-4370-a38d-07ab8a9c94b2-1
00:14:54.953 --> 00:14:57.960
value that is there in investing in sport.

0cd77ad5-238b-41ea-a935-82a353b19e94-0
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.108
Although it is changing especially in the
last 3-4 years with the new government

0cd77ad5-238b-41ea-a935-82a353b19e94-1
00:15:03.108 --> 00:15:06.467
that we have,
we have seen a shift in terms of certain

0cd77ad5-238b-41ea-a935-82a353b19e94-2
00:15:06.467 --> 00:15:09.400
partners appreciating the value that
sport has.

d70583ca-9323-41dd-bc51-a7d7b3154c11-0
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.495
And we are we are looking at an increase
in terms of one off support to sports

d70583ca-9323-41dd-bc51-a7d7b3154c11-1
00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:16.000
events.

defa4a36-142b-408b-ab17-1b564563ac30-0
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.614
But what we're looking for in the long
term is where we have got partners that

defa4a36-142b-408b-ab17-1b564563ac30-1
00:15:21.614 --> 00:15:26.480
are providing funding in a structured way
or in a structured approach.

054f51e5-d739-42e6-9479-96eddce3146d-0
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.280
So those are some of the challenges that
we have.

6c40c633-bae9-4d43-9a67-8173bec221b6-0
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.865
Others could be, you know,
non adherence to certain protocols

6c40c633-bae9-4d43-9a67-8173bec221b6-1
00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:40.014
related to safeguarding of athletes and
the wealth and also safeguarding the

6c40c633-bae9-4d43-9a67-8173bec221b6-2
00:15:40.014 --> 00:15:43.960
welfare of athletes especially when it
comes to education.

65eb5ded-f0ef-4f2c-893b-32d93f6b2616-0
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.131
Some of the athletes that we have,
some of the top athletes that have have

65eb5ded-f0ef-4f2c-893b-32d93f6b2616-1
00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:48.320
not gone far in the education.

05df5349-b449-4fb1-8efd-81a504ecf93e-0
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.372
And for me,
I consider to be an injustice whereby an

05df5349-b449-4fb1-8efd-81a504ecf93e-1
00:15:51.372 --> 00:15:55.766
athlete is bringing medals to the country,
lifting the Zambian flag high and yet we

05df5349-b449-4fb1-8efd-81a504ecf93e-2
00:15:55.766 --> 00:15:59.846
are not addressing their challenges when
it comes to their education but also

05df5349-b449-4fb1-8efd-81a504ecf93e-3
00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:00.840
career development.

42bc2c65-fd3b-44e2-94a8-a5bcb85f1ca2-0
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.305
So we need to invest more in terms of
athlete welfare,

42bc2c65-fd3b-44e2-94a8-a5bcb85f1ca2-1
00:16:04.305 --> 00:16:07.440
athlete career development as well as
their their education.

bdcc5c1b-f1c6-4539-95b5-86e0cba44b1d-0
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.157
Some of the challenge,
another challenge that obviously is the

bdcc5c1b-f1c6-4539-95b5-86e0cba44b1d-1
00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:15.413
effects mostly women but also effects all
of us is where we have not invested

bdcc5c1b-f1c6-4539-95b5-86e0cba44b1d-2
00:16:15.413 --> 00:16:18.032
hugely in,
in terms of increasing the number of

bdcc5c1b-f1c6-4539-95b5-86e0cba44b1d-3
00:16:18.032 --> 00:16:20.160
women and girls participating in sport.

b83736f0-052c-4b04-8b91-a6ebf6f93ba4-0
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.799
There was a research professor that was
done in Southern Africa through African

b83736f0-052c-4b04-8b91-a6ebf6f93ba4-1
00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:30.852
Mutual Sports Council Region 5 and
Stellenbosch University of South Africa,

b83736f0-052c-4b04-8b91-a6ebf6f93ba4-2
00:16:30.852 --> 00:16:35.773
where it was find found that 17% of the
out of the total number of people

b83736f0-052c-4b04-8b91-a6ebf6f93ba4-3
00:16:35.773 --> 00:16:40.760
participating in in sport and physical
activity, only 17% represent women.

180e94e2-5c88-47d4-8db4-7a9cba5426b1-0
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.191
In other parts,
you'll find that only 1% of women

180e94e2-5c88-47d4-8db4-7a9cba5426b1-1
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:50.554
actually participate in sport,
which is very alarming and that has to

180e94e2-5c88-47d4-8db4-7a9cba5426b1-2
00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:53.160
change now and in the near future.

ac508038-0a3f-4395-9d89-79701493f090-0
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.480
So those are some of the challenges.

2c09af16-939c-4741-b160-2b91cdb0eee7-0
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.979
Apart from inclusion of people with
disability in sport,

2c09af16-939c-4741-b160-2b91cdb0eee7-1
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:01.953
there's still some bit of stigma here and
there,

2c09af16-939c-4741-b160-2b91cdb0eee7-2
00:17:01.953 --> 00:17:06.990
people or persons with disability and not
fully involved in participation in sport

2c09af16-939c-4741-b160-2b91cdb0eee7-3
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.449
at different levels,
whether it is mere participation or

2c09af16-939c-4741-b160-2b91cdb0eee7-4
00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:13.120
competition,
but also at leadership levels.

c6f4d8c4-bcf1-44d5-a4d2-75fe0559f966-0
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.887
So quite a number of challenges,
but again, the government,

c6f4d8c4-bcf1-44d5-a4d2-75fe0559f966-1
00:17:17.887 --> 00:17:21.367
I'm happy to note that the government
that we have now,

c6f4d8c4-bcf1-44d5-a4d2-75fe0559f966-2
00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:26.027
the New Dawn government is taking
important strides and measures to ensure

c6f4d8c4-bcf1-44d5-a4d2-75fe0559f966-3
00:17:26.027 --> 00:17:29.320
that we attend to all these challenges
that we have.

36e57291-fcf1-4014-a92c-0c19e75cd112-0
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.363
And some of the the some of the measures
that have been taken is to increase

36e57291-fcf1-4014-a92c-0c19e75cd112-1
00:17:36.363 --> 00:17:38.120
investment in sport.

93f377b7-6bff-450c-8ca5-8b2350d8d332-0
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.739
And when you look at the budget that we
have four years ago before this

93f377b7-6bff-450c-8ca5-8b2350d8d332-1
00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:46.295
government came in,
came in in place is way different from

93f377b7-6bff-450c-8ca5-8b2350d8d332-2
00:17:46.295 --> 00:17:47.320
what we have now.

1f2ec745-a5c5-4bb0-b24f-cb2ac843ed31-0
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.861
So there's been an exponential growth in
terms of the amount of money that is

1f2ec745-a5c5-4bb0-b24f-cb2ac843ed31-1
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:54.480
being invested in sport.

5b5390e8-313f-4cfe-92f8-6ae16dc1ce29-0
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.116
We still have a long way,
but at least there is that political will

5b5390e8-313f-4cfe-92f8-6ae16dc1ce29-1
00:17:59.116 --> 00:18:04.364
that gives us hope that even as we go
into the future there will be more money

5b5390e8-313f-4cfe-92f8-6ae16dc1ce29-2
00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:05.560
invested in sport.

e4adca9e-91c5-4660-8a82-00927bcc4092-0
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.070
The government is also looking at
infrastructure development,

e4adca9e-91c5-4660-8a82-00927bcc4092-1
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.135
rehabilitation of the existing ones,
but also putting up a new infrastructure

e4adca9e-91c5-4660-8a82-00927bcc4092-2
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:15.480
in across all the 10 provinces that we
have.

95295ede-c7c5-424e-9a25-67dd90e85457-0
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.664
We have got also an increase in terms of
the number of coaches and sport

95295ede-c7c5-424e-9a25-67dd90e85457-1
00:18:19.664 --> 00:18:23.757
administrators that are being trained on
a regular basis together with our

95295ede-c7c5-424e-9a25-67dd90e85457-2
00:18:23.757 --> 00:18:27.632
partners such as the National Political
Media of Zambia and sports for

95295ede-c7c5-424e-9a25-67dd90e85457-3
00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:28.560
development NGOs.

848ddc5c-1e2c-4ea9-91e2-2febb78b6724-0
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.505
The Minister of Education is also,
you know,

848ddc5c-1e2c-4ea9-91e2-2febb78b6724-1
00:18:32.505 --> 00:18:36.000
restructuring how they're attending to
physical education.

6d1f4f56-2c39-4b8c-8b02-fbb29937e707-0
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:44.341
And we understand that the bedrock of top
talented athletes for going into the

6d1f4f56-2c39-4b8c-8b02-fbb29937e707-1
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:50.125
future relies on a very strong of
providing or delivering physical

6d1f4f56-2c39-4b8c-8b02-fbb29937e707-2
00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:51.680
education as well.

e199b667-1a97-4bb8-9592-f15bb8f537ca-0
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.640
So we need quality physical education and
sport being delivered in schools.

0527cd1e-8b91-4b39-9c7a-9892f284c0a1-0
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.813
So those are some of the measures that
are being undertaken to see that we

0527cd1e-8b91-4b39-9c7a-9892f284c0a1-1
00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:03.240
reduce on some of the challenges that we
are facing as a country.

5cb30790-f83b-4521-8bd6-d8061c17b344-0
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.400
You talk, you talk, you mentioned about,
you know, physical education, right?

9c6195a6-aa36-4733-91d4-23f2524df877-0
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.535
You're talking about, you know,
the role of the ministry, you know,

9c6195a6-aa36-4733-91d4-23f2524df877-1
00:19:11.535 --> 00:19:16.157
and could you expand a little bit more in
terms of grass roots development,

9c6195a6-aa36-4733-91d4-23f2524df877-2
00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:20.293
you know, and specifically about,
you know, the talent development,

9c6195a6-aa36-4733-91d4-23f2524df877-3
00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:23.151
you know,
can you share how the National Sport

9c6195a6-aa36-4733-91d4-23f2524df877-4
00:19:23.151 --> 00:19:28.138
Council is supporting grassroots sports
and working to identify and nurture young

9c6195a6-aa36-4733-91d4-23f2524df877-5
00:19:28.138 --> 00:19:29.720
talent across the country?

141c3d16-e532-4e60-847e-9c0d8214191c-0
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:33.960
Indeed.

6995572f-34e5-4fac-8fc2-6868525a7585-0
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.659
So when it comes to,
I'll begin with the National Sports

6995572f-34e5-4fac-8fc2-6868525a7585-1
00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:41.948
Policy, which was revised last year,
which is delivered by the Ministry of

6995572f-34e5-4fac-8fc2-6868525a7585-2
00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:46.465
your sport and aspect also implemented by
the National Sports Council of Zamba

6995572f-34e5-4fac-8fc2-6868525a7585-3
00:19:46.465 --> 00:19:50.640
through the various national sports
federations and other sports groups.

2415ac01-d822-4b98-802d-3577a3d6d833-0
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.283
So within the National Sports Policy,
talent identification is one of the

2415ac01-d822-4b98-802d-3577a3d6d833-1
00:19:55.283 --> 00:19:56.160
priority areas.

0db6ced6-8200-4397-96f8-6fb7be0e6977-0
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.953
We need to come up with scientific
approaches in terms of talent

0db6ced6-8200-4397-96f8-6fb7be0e6977-1
00:19:59.953 --> 00:20:01.880
identification, which is missing.

a5292860-b5c4-4495-970e-2901c871f4d3-0
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.442
In most cases we still depending on
traditional ways of identifying talent

a5292860-b5c4-4495-970e-2901c871f4d3-1
00:20:06.442 --> 00:20:10.950
but that is something that is not being
done by the top sporting countries in the

a5292860-b5c4-4495-970e-2901c871f4d3-2
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.280
world.

7bca51d0-2298-491a-b894-ae9eb6283ae3-0
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.897
Then we have got a strategic plan our own
as National Sports Council and again

7bca51d0-2298-491a-b894-ae9eb6283ae3-1
00:20:16.897 --> 00:20:20.960
talent education and development
especially for the grass roots is key.

679719b8-bb90-4a24-9715-747610d34030-0
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.202
So we have, we, we,
we share the content of the strategic

679719b8-bb90-4a24-9715-747610d34030-1
00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:29.270
plan with key stakeholders,
especially in the national federations

679719b8-bb90-4a24-9715-747610d34030-2
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.185
and the requirement by National Sports
Council,

679719b8-bb90-4a24-9715-747610d34030-3
00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:37.044
all an expectation of the National Sports
Council of the National Federation is

679719b8-bb90-4a24-9715-747610d34030-4
00:20:37.044 --> 00:20:41.720
that the need to cast their net wide when
it comes to talent identification.

bf34aefd-734d-4512-8b89-94c1b49bfbf8-0
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.998
In most cases you'll find National
Federation's identifying talent across

bf34aefd-734d-4512-8b89-94c1b49bfbf8-1
00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:48.440
along the Rhino rail.

00fa1a76-d990-4546-9099-af64b787c4a9-0
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.557
We have got one rail that stretches from
the South all the way to the Koppal

00fa1a76-d990-4546-9099-af64b787c4a9-1
00:20:53.557 --> 00:20:56.880
province and further up to the northern
province.

909e86e2-bf4c-4203-a314-f91465f83a1a-0
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.040
But we can't continue that that man.

c0f46fb8-26fc-449f-8114-0d313011bb84-0
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.720
What about the rest of the provinces?

78dc2b2e-c0fb-4b21-b05c-361b4e8cf217-0
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.538
What are we doing in terms of making sure
that we deliberately come up with

78dc2b2e-c0fb-4b21-b05c-361b4e8cf217-1
00:21:06.538 --> 00:21:10.327
approaches,
talent education strategies and that be

78dc2b2e-c0fb-4b21-b05c-361b4e8cf217-2
00:21:10.327 --> 00:21:14.408
able to help us in response to the to
those challenges,

78dc2b2e-c0fb-4b21-b05c-361b4e8cf217-3
00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:19.000
especially when it comes to funding for
talent identification?

cfa675b1-314e-4252-bb32-7050869b9dde-0
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.383
We have come up as a national sports
council working closely with the Ministry

cfa675b1-314e-4252-bb32-7050869b9dde-1
00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:26.552
of Youth Sport and as a national
federation's come up with a program that

cfa675b1-314e-4252-bb32-7050869b9dde-2
00:21:26.552 --> 00:21:28.480
we call the Rural Sport Development
Program.

f6f9d809-28fc-41cf-abd4-fc926bc3a743-0
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.938
This is a new program that has never been
delivered in the country and we just

f6f9d809-28fc-41cf-abd4-fc926bc3a743-1
00:21:33.938 --> 00:21:39.021
started doing it recently this year that
will be precise and the main aim is to

f6f9d809-28fc-41cf-abd4-fc926bc3a743-2
00:21:39.021 --> 00:21:44.040
take structured sport to the rural areas
that are deprived of organized sport.

61ce4d2d-6e96-443c-b2b6-59247e43d843-0
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.410
So in there one some of the priorities
that we have are talent,

61ce4d2d-6e96-443c-b2b6-59247e43d843-1
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.019
education and development capacity,
development of coaches,

61ce4d2d-6e96-443c-b2b6-59247e43d843-2
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.787
sport administrators and technical
officials,

61ce4d2d-6e96-443c-b2b6-59247e43d843-3
00:21:54.787 --> 00:21:59.720
construction of basic sports facilities
that can be used by rural based athletes.

1549f3b2-5152-4b24-9b82-112670e90feb-0
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.080
And we want to involve partners.

f50cf305-1159-4705-8655-2d6b54c09c66-0
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.315
When we involve the National Federation
to go to all the rural areas of this

f50cf305-1159-4705-8655-2d6b54c09c66-1
00:22:06.315 --> 00:22:10.165
country and identify that it include
these talented athletes in their

f50cf305-1159-4705-8655-2d6b54c09c66-2
00:22:10.165 --> 00:22:14.400
programming but also include them in the
national teams and their adventure.

290670c7-33a7-4819-bc53-6e80408b2f25-0
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.880
Our hope is that some of these top.

7c19dab7-d528-4507-a315-cc04ab2d2829-0
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.920
But we can have more.

92169fbe-c9c2-495e-8c7f-950951b04b1e-0
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.121
Some of these athletes will go all the
way to participate in the Region 5 Youth

92169fbe-c9c2-495e-8c7f-950951b04b1e-1
00:22:27.121 --> 00:22:30.651
Games, in the African Games,
in the Commonwealth Games,

92169fbe-c9c2-495e-8c7f-950951b04b1e-2
00:22:30.651 --> 00:22:32.920
all the way up to the Olympic Games.

78599763-651a-4cba-97ad-991d40ad3df0-0
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.578
And we hope that they can be able to
compete favourably,

78599763-651a-4cba-97ad-991d40ad3df0-1
00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:41.664
including winning medals and other when
it comes to major events that are hosted

78599763-651a-4cba-97ad-991d40ad3df0-2
00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:42.920
at the global level.

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-0
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.620
Now let's let's turn into the some of the
strategic partnerships, you know,

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-1
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.989
could you talk a little bit about that,
You know, what type of partnerships,

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-2
00:22:55.989 --> 00:22:59.685
you know, the National Sport Council have,
you know,

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-3
00:22:59.685 --> 00:23:04.986
whether this is the private sector,
you talk touch a little bit this before

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-4
00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:08.891
that, you know,
private sector with other governmental,

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-5
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:13.424
you know, ministries, you know,
or even international, you know,

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-6
00:23:13.424 --> 00:23:18.724
organizations in terms of, you know,
support the whole sport development in

968c8e1b-5fa6-4d01-888e-8a5ef7f0d091-7
00:23:18.724 --> 00:23:19.840
some way indeed.

be800fd9-9227-4a39-b769-14c53f15cd9c-0
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.787

development NGOs apart from played

00:24:07.977 --> 00:24:12.883
forward down in the South of this country
that actually complementing government

07af3b73-2e79-46db-abca-ab62f4d0af30-2
00:24:12.883 --> 00:24:15.789
efforts,
especially when it comes to grassroots

07af3b73-2e79-46db-abca-ab62f4d0af30-3
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:16.880
sport development.

ae265a2d-4fff-4f33-9077-c8e5551a7a81-0

a892871b-86fa-44b6-8528-e608eab655cd-0
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.166
You know,
issues to do with the use of sport as a

a892871b-86fa-44b6-8528-e608eab655cd-1
00:24:26.166 --> 00:24:30.089
tool for prevention and reduction of HIV

a892871b-86fa-44b6-8528-e608eab655cd-2
00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:36.396
but also NGOs that are involved in using
sports to create an income or empowering

a892871b-86fa-44b6-8528-e608eab655cd-3
00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:41.320
people that are coming from vulnerable
sections of our society.

bf16114a-141b-4d63-b7c2-1fc2a1afc5c3-0
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.760
So we do work also with the private
sector.

dbef13cf-abdd-4aeb-8e45-7452ac5a5c59-0
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.954
Like I mentioned before,
we have seen an increase in the number of

dbef13cf-abdd-4aeb-8e45-7452ac5a5c59-1
00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:52.620
private sector organizations that are
partnering with us,

dbef13cf-abdd-4aeb-8e45-7452ac5a5c59-2
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.844
supporting different events,
especially marathons,

dbef13cf-abdd-4aeb-8e45-7452ac5a5c59-3

across the region.

a39c4f41-4479-4b09-94a2-efa70d1ac731-0
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.720
We do work with African Union Sports
Council Region 5.

443af0cd-c848-44c9-83cd-66acd9e3a0be-0
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.212
Mind you,
Africa in terms of the sports development

443af0cd-c848-44c9-83cd-66acd9e3a0be-1
00:25:08.212 --> 00:25:09.880
is divided in five regions.

777fb310-24ba-49b3-a633-a1f816ad32b1-0
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.217
So ours is Region 5,
but we've got Region 1 which is in the

777fb310-24ba-49b3-a633-a1f816ad32b1-1
00:25:14.217 --> 00:25:17.080
north of Africa,
Region 2 is in West Africa,

777fb310-24ba-49b3-a633-a1f816ad32b1-2
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.916
Region 4 is in Central Africa region,
Region 3 and then Region 4 is in East

777fb310-24ba-49b3-a633-a1f816ad32b1-3
00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:26.306
Africa and then Region 5 is where Zambia
is, South Africa, Zimbabwe,

777fb310-24ba-49b3-a633-a1f816ad32b1-4
00:25:26.306 --> 00:25:29.360
Botswana and Namibia and a few other
countries.

93d02be5-6ad3-4308-aa42-6eeb937f4f99-0
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.705
So we do work with the African Union in,
in different areas,

93d02be5-6ad3-4308-aa42-6eeb937f4f99-1
00:25:33.705 --> 00:25:38.852
whether it's high performance sport,
whether it's participation in high level

93d02be5-6ad3-4308-aa42-6eeb937f4f99-2
00:25:38.852 --> 00:25:41.360
Region 5 youth games and other events.

695d7cc7-d11c-48dc-be22-8b347cea386a-0
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.780
We have not spread our wings very much in
terms of working with others,

695d7cc7-d11c-48dc-be22-8b347cea386a-1
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.480
other organizations away from the region.

1a1eb4ba-1b1e-42b7-a9d8-3e634fe17207-0
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.996
But before then we used to work with the
with the, an organization called NIF,

1a1eb4ba-1b1e-42b7-a9d8-3e634fe17207-1
00:25:54.996 --> 00:25:59.953
which is the National Olympic,
the Olympic Committee and Confederation

1a1eb4ba-1b1e-42b7-a9d8-3e634fe17207-2

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.816
So we worked with them quite a lot when
it,

4685afdb-de62-4bd3-b507-940077379c53-1
00:26:04.816 --> 00:26:09.395
when we were delivering back in the days
when we're delivered what we use for the

4685afdb-de62-4bd3-b507-940077379c53-2
00:26:09.395 --> 00:26:10.400
sports or project.

68e37e26-88c9-4b06-9472-8e35ebc2deec-0
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.444
We have not worked with them closely or
directly, but we work with,

68e37e26-88c9-4b06-9472-8e35ebc2deec-1
00:26:15.444 --> 00:26:18.600
they work with the number of sports NGOs
in the country.

a1c22db0-c931-41b3-a345-21fed2e06834-0
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.133
They work with the number of national
federations and they do work with the

a1c22db0-c931-41b3-a345-21fed2e06834-1
00:26:22.133 --> 00:26:23.800
African Union Sports Council Region 5.

c92a5d25-a0dc-4fe3-abe1-9602008f9795-0
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.914
When I was working as programs manager at
the African Union Sports Council Region 5,

c92a5d25-a0dc-4fe3-abe1-9602008f9795-1
00:26:28.914 --> 00:26:32.699
I did work closely with them,
especially when it came to capacity

c92a5d25-a0dc-4fe3-abe1-9602008f9795-2
00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:36.083
development programs for coaches and
sport administrators,

c92a5d25-a0dc-4fe3-abe1-9602008f9795-3
00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:40.040
but also the use of sport as a tool for
gender inclusion and equity.

7a8601da-7edd-445c-818f-db3631a65960-0
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.840
Now in terms of a strategic vision, OK,
what are the Council's key strategic

7a8601da-7edd-445c-818f-db3631a65960-1
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.467
priorities over the next five years and
what do you see the greatest

7a8601da-7edd-445c-818f-db3631a65960-2
00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:59.258
opportunities for growth indeed, you know,
you know the order per say,

7a8601da-7edd-445c-818f-db3631a65960-3
00:26:59.258 --> 00:27:03.254
but number one,
capacity development of coaches,

7a8601da-7edd-445c-818f-db3631a65960-4
00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:06.680
sport administrators, technical officials.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.152
We need to increase the number of
competent qualified people that are able

1827340c-68a9-4763-ada0-a52b23be732f-1
00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:16.440
to effectively manage sport development
at different levels.

d72051da-4e56-4ef3-97a5-2c80ca7fda8a-0
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.640
We need people that are able to
effectively manage transfer sport.

We need people that are able to
effectively manage high performance sport.

8f57fe8d-fab5-4906-b67a-460e40454642-0
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.662
We need people who are qualified to be
placed in the different organizations

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.088
We need qualified more qualified people
at the Sports Council,

acf03ab9-a509-4aa4-b0e3-53837c5820a6-1
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:38.960
National Olympic Committee and those that
are heading the national federations.

bf09a2cf-7f21-4caf-b1a5-b4fbb27e1dad-0
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.320
Infrastructure development is key.

fe69ca03-520b-4f2e-9c56-5c871f92d4ca-0
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.335
One of our mandate as the National Sports
Council as the enshrined in the Sports

fe69ca03-520b-4f2e-9c56-5c871f92d4ca-1
00:27:46.335 --> 00:27:51.109
Council of Zambia Act Chapter 142 of 1988
is that we should be able to involve

00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:53.829
ourselves in the construction of
facilities,

fe69ca03-520b-4f2e-9c56-5c871f92d4ca-3
00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:58.120
maintenance of facilities across all the

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.440
The other priority areas is talent
identification.

a391454e-b73f-4f5a-a7f5-b28c6304aa97-0
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.401
We need to put in a systematic approach
or system in terms of talent

a391454e-b73f-4f5a-a7f5-b28c6304aa97-1
00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:08.480
identification.

eccff57d-dda2-41f3-acec-a98e894d7039-0
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.616
That is the only way that we can be able
to, you know,

eccff57d-dda2-41f3-acec-a98e894d7039-1
00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:17.373
to achieve more in terms of top
performing athletes that this country can

eccff57d-dda2-41f3-acec-a98e894d7039-2

ever be,
can ever produce that can be able to

eccff57d-dda2-41f3-acec-a98e894d7039-3
00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:24.960
perform favourably including winning of
medals at international events.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.101
Some of others include the gender
inclusion and equity,

20aa7748-1853-4eb0-9c9f-56d880d90a15-1
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:32.203
increasing the number of women and girls
participating,

20aa7748-1853-4eb0-9c9f-56d880d90a15-2
00:28:32.203 --> 00:28:34.640
participating in sport at different
levels.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.160
We need more women participating in
leadership of sport in the country.

d3981ccd-5bf5-4f3b-9a79-9064061ae4dc-0
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.555
We have few,
we have not done so much research as a

d3981ccd-5bf5-4f3b-9a79-9064061ae4dc-1
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:48.041
country, but we have got very,
very few women but who are leaders in the

d3981ccd-5bf5-4f3b-9a79-9064061ae4dc-2
00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:52.220
different National Federation, sport NGOs,
a sports council itself,

d3981ccd-5bf5-4f3b-9a79-9064061ae4dc-3

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.880
We need more girls participating in sport.

20dbb82c-33af-4776-9e33-ddc8d66b6b84-0
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.364
We need more girls being identified,
you know,

20dbb82c-33af-4776-9e33-ddc8d66b6b84-1
00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:02.320
to be included in the national teams.

3206b877-d1ea-4cb7-9eca-e7aaebfd580f-0
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.439
We need parity in terms of we need pay
parity when it comes to rewarding our

3206b877-d1ea-4cb7-9eca-e7aaebfd580f-1
00:29:08.439 --> 00:29:09.880
athletes right now.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.321
You know,
when it comes to payment of athletes,

d20e5a0a-0683-4656-b99f-cf6f07a4e292-1

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.284
But what is comforting now profits is
that this government that we have

a3d61c86-e7c9-4950-8ee8-58d23f4f87f5-1
00:29:23.284 --> 00:29:28.709
actually has brought in preparatory when
if you look at an example I can give you

is the women football team which is doing
rate at the African level but also has

a3d61c86-e7c9-4950-8ee8-58d23f4f87f5-3
00:29:34.069 --> 00:29:39.495
participated twice at the Olympic Games
and also at the World Cup compared to the

a3d61c86-e7c9-4950-8ee8-58d23f4f87f5-4
00:29:39.495 --> 00:29:39.760
men.

0c2f3904-35eb-4868-a08d-f5c95502a9ae-0
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.574
And So what the government did is that
whatever the men get in terms of rewards

0c2f3904-35eb-4868-a08d-f5c95502a9ae-1
00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:48.995
is the same amount that the women get,
the same opportunities that the women,

0c2f3904-35eb-4868-a08d-f5c95502a9ae-2
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:53.133
the men are getting are the same
opportunities that the women be able to

0c2f3904-35eb-4868-a08d-f5c95502a9ae-3
00:29:53.133 --> 00:29:53.360
get.

953fee38-16dd-4fc7-b815-f2142c6da111-0
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.790
So it is working well with football,
it's working well when it comes to

953fee38-16dd-4fc7-b815-f2142c6da111-1
00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.880
Zambia's participation in multi sport
events.

fb53f4d3-ea08-487b-b841-bf9403461779-0
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:06.652
But we need to ensure that that is that
is obtaining a different levels in all

fb53f4d3-ea08-487b-b841-bf9403461779-1
00:30:06.652 --> 00:30:09.200
this in all the federation.

71dd5570-32c7-42aa-904a-ecf78de682f7-0
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.947
So these are some of the the strategic
priorities including creation of

71dd5570-32c7-42aa-904a-ecf78de682f7-1
00:30:14.947 --> 00:30:20.880
sustainable partner partnerships with
local and international organizations.

8cf09320-43d6-4c5a-8632-2d0b42cc58eb-0
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.760
Research is also key.

6c4f234e-4a94-4239-b32b-172cbbee816a-0
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.480
We are doing very few.

72aa0695-2c44-4cdf-aa28-18f279159aa5-0
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.763
We're,
we're involving ourselves in less

72aa0695-2c44-4cdf-aa28-18f279159aa5-1
00:30:27.763 --> 00:30:30.520
research when it comes to sport
development in the country.

a50cf194-1eda-4682-8c5d-4e872a542ac3-0
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.894
But we need universities that we have
like the University of Zambia,

a50cf194-1eda-4682-8c5d-4e872a542ac3-1
00:30:34.894 --> 00:30:39.582
Croma University to involve themselves in
partnership with the National Sports

a50cf194-1eda-4682-8c5d-4e872a542ac3-2
00:30:39.582 --> 00:30:43.440
Council and other organization to involve
ourselves in research.

6f5386b1-7201-4682-bbd5-2be94772804e-0
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.551
Because when we conduct research,
we are making decisions based on facts

6f5386b1-7201-4682-bbd5-2be94772804e-1
00:30:49.551 --> 00:30:51.880
and not empirical knowledge.

506a912f-e565-41cc-b238-024d4f7958e9-0
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.974
So we it's,
those are some of the priorities that we

506a912f-e565-41cc-b238-024d4f7958e9-1
00:30:54.974 --> 00:30:55.240
have.

d25c6ca7-8224-4c2c-b1ea-425173811682-0
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.078
There could be more,
but also these priorities are supported

d25c6ca7-8224-4c2c-b1ea-425173811682-1
00:30:59.078 --> 00:31:00.400
by different strategies.

b044b4a6-741d-4608-9bcc-388019ff9fe2-0
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.495
So that at the end of the day,
it's not just the medals that we are

b044b4a6-741d-4608-9bcc-388019ff9fe2-1
00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:05.080
looking at.

4b37f334-eb8a-4119-a9b9-d38501fb7b4b-0
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.280
We are looking at empowering these young
people.

05fe9f01-5378-4755-86c1-d5c0d99ac013-0
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.930
We are looking at empowering the
Zambian's through sport and physical

05fe9f01-5378-4755-86c1-d5c0d99ac013-1
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:12.400
activity.

7f8dce08-8280-4ca8-8509-e6f6db123dd6-0
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:14.960
Mr.

d5f30824-3b0c-4cfb-815b-33dacad31eb1-0
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.008
Musunsa,
thank you very much for your thoughtful

d5f30824-3b0c-4cfb-815b-33dacad31eb1-1
00:31:18.008 --> 00:31:21.680
reflections and for sharing your
experience with us today.

f523ab67-0cbe-49a9-88c0-6ba8a9dd1dd1-0
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.117
Your insights provide an invaluable
perspective into the management of

f523ab67-0cbe-49a9-88c0-6ba8a9dd1dd1-1
00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:30.680
Sporting Zambia and across the African
continent more broadly right now.

d1f25f6a-2e7b-407c-a27f-9fe652f09924-0
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.767
To our participants,
I hope this conversation has enriched

d1f25f6a-2e7b-407c-a27f-9fe652f09924-1
00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:39.893
your understanding of how National Sport
Councils operate and the kind of

d1f25f6a-2e7b-407c-a27f-9fe652f09924-2
00:31:39.893 --> 00:31:45.019
leaderships and innovations required to
advance sports systems in complex

d1f25f6a-2e7b-407c-a27f-9fe652f09924-3
00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:45.920
environments.

166e0c67-70c9-47bb-a580-72077f07e440-0
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.160
Once again, Mr.

e5e94ccb-35eb-428e-8c17-b6dfaf6c3604-0
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.211
Musunsa,
thank you for your time and for joining

e5e94ccb-35eb-428e-8c17-b6dfaf6c3604-1
00:31:50.211 --> 00:31:52.080
us in this important dialogue.
