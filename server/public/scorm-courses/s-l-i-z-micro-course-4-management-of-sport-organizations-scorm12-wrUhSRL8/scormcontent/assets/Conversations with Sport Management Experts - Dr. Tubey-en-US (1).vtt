Thank you, Professor Bravo.

1fa1614d-1775-4c91-ba7a-cb88286f1047-0
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.348
Let's start this conversation first by
tell us or elaborate a little bit about

1fa1614d-1775-4c91-ba7a-cb88286f1047-1
00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:25.543
your background, OK, Which is I, you know,
mentions a few things about what you have

1fa1614d-1775-4c91-ba7a-cb88286f1047-2
00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:29.393
done, your training,
but what inspired you interested in sport

1fa1614d-1775-4c91-ba7a-cb88286f1047-3
00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:33.000
tourism and issues related to climate
change, for example?

1f48e9e4-bc7d-44f1-a912-6a1faf04de7f-0
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.280
Well, interesting you should ask me that,
Prof.

46cec05d-b098-4815-a335-7e09000ca96a-0
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.840
I am.

d42ede80-eaa9-476b-96df-5c2a6f4aacbf-0
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.428
I grew up in the Highlands of Kenya,
specifically in a county known as Nandi

d42ede80-eaa9-476b-96df-5c2a6f4aacbf-1
00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:47.320
County that is the source of champions.

77e2199b-49a9-44ce-836c-99162c01de4d-0
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.240
It is where we have our great athletes.

03c7d9f8-906c-4490-8562-70bf54ea03ee-0
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.993
Kenya is known as a powerhouse of
athletics and I grew up in the same

03c7d9f8-906c-4490-8562-70bf54ea03ee-1
00:02:55.993 --> 00:03:00.990
neighborhood as Faith Kipiago and as
Eluduki, as Eluduki Keno,

03c7d9f8-906c-4490-8562-70bf54ea03ee-2
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.640
as all these great athletes that we have
now.

fd6da8c7-c509-454f-b7d1-4ff0db2ba193-0
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.080
That in itself growing up in that space
gives you the inspiration to, you know,

fd6da8c7-c509-454f-b7d1-4ff0db2ba193-1
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.360
want to participate.

e4b922ff-20b6-411b-a314-f736ee5b346e-0
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.986
And then unfortunately,
I was too slow for the Kenyan athletes,

e4b922ff-20b6-411b-a314-f736ee5b346e-1
00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:19.240
so I did not make it to,
to the to the team.

bb268fa1-ee2f-41ad-ab2a-519522aeab2c-0
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.517
But with time,
I found myself within the tourism

bb268fa1-ee2f-41ad-ab2a-519522aeab2c-1
00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:23.120
industry.

118eb640-2427-43d4-82a6-b857fea9a223-0
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.080
I'm a trained hotelier and in that space,
it's a leisure industry.

59674065-bad6-4fe7-bb03-c96853f275d7-0
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.094
There's a lot of adventure,
there's a lot of fun,

59674065-bad6-4fe7-bb03-c96853f275d7-1
00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:34.411
there's a lot of sports and I was
thinking, Oh my God,

59674065-bad6-4fe7-bb03-c96853f275d7-2
00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:36.160
this is my childhood passion.

3e59495a-475c-4aad-ba85-e55ed33570a8-0
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.280
I love tourism, I love sports.

6f1c8395-85f8-4d26-8e3c-575c2943a610-0
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.760
Why not make it a thing?

5df515e9-7f9e-4cd1-9904-97e4a743c899-0
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.586
Why not make it my thing now that I
couldn't run when I can research in that

5df515e9-7f9e-4cd1-9904-97e4a743c899-1
00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:46.040
space.

01227db1-1be0-4296-9566-fb5a30354c05-0
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.880
Thank you prof.

736fbb68-a64c-4aa4-9e86-9a6eee0d86f0-0
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.680
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

ee911f28-6ffc-4712-83f6-d6dee82c4c57-0
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.480
Very interesting.

6f52ee31-96fd-42db-98ad-3e673b69fa1c-0
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.085
You know,
and interesting that you mentioned about

6f52ee31-96fd-42db-98ad-3e673b69fa1c-1
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:54.691
that, that, that,
that specifically part of Kenya,

6f52ee31-96fd-42db-98ad-3e673b69fa1c-2
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:58.369
which is I don't have actually the, the,
the privilege to, to be there,

6f52ee31-96fd-42db-98ad-3e673b69fa1c-3
00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.720
but I hopefully one day I will,
I will visit.

8b4d9d50-0b02-4d13-add5-55381b115341-0
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.720
You know that you're you're much welcome.

0972f648-ceaf-41e2-a537-608d83f04ddc-0
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.085
Now for those less familiar, you know,
could you provide us an overview,

0972f648-ceaf-41e2-a537-608d83f04ddc-1
00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:12.160
a brief overview of the sport development
in Kenya in your country, right?

2a744870-187f-46ab-a94c-6bacf5edaa9a-0
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.720
And what have been some of the country's
major achievements?

4112639e-5ddc-48c9-904a-9bd14a6d9b16-0
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.048
You already mentioned about, you know,
the long history, right,

4112639e-5ddc-48c9-904a-9bd14a6d9b16-1
00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:22.948
which is well known about, you know,
athletes, you know, in long distance,

4112639e-5ddc-48c9-904a-9bd14a6d9b16-2
00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:25.600
you know, events in track, you know,
in marathons,

4112639e-5ddc-48c9-904a-9bd14a6d9b16-3
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.240
but all but who are some of those,
you know, iconic athletes as well?

a8edaa16-4031-4bc0-b557-add2dedf3835-0
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.320
If you can give us a little bit of
background about that.

1b0819a0-54d1-4e0d-b551-8229f5291488-0
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.360
Well,
Kenya is largely a sporting destination.

f6dee2d0-0d37-4215-b564-4295dfb332e1-0
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.160
We, we do not just excellent athletics,
we athletic, we excel in track.

22de1413-1a2c-498b-bce5-c38255233042-0
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.755
We also excel in sports like volleyball,
football, which well,

22de1413-1a2c-498b-bce5-c38255233042-1
00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:47.840
we're struggling a bit on that.

e8025a5d-b54e-4e0e-9f96-4ea178cccda5-0
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.320
But then also we have rugby and there's
so many other spaces within which we do

e8025a5d-b54e-4e0e-9f96-4ea178cccda5-1
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.840
very well.

81408265-53e3-43f8-b434-7167aeceafb9-0
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.640
We've been known for cricket for quite a
while.

016bdc77-7374-4e30-87be-af0d309789db-0
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.800
We were champions of Africa for such a
while.

b51fc29d-126d-4d8f-8e46-d56feaace2c9-0
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.560
We are,
we are the African champions for we all.

4df9d36e-f93f-4b64-941e-e118f11a3e13-0
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.000
We get to the finals actually in the
Rugby 57 finals.

2e68c1cd-95f2-48ca-b389-e6909be9ca46-0
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.120
So you can see we are a country that
loves sports now.

c1c797a2-545f-4b8e-bc3a-bc3991c0a281-0
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.689
We've had a challenge when it comes to
development of sporting itself in terms

c1c797a2-545f-4b8e-bc3a-bc3991c0a281-1
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.950
of infrastructure, in terms of, you know,
academies where we purely can't train the

c1c797a2-545f-4b8e-bc3a-bc3991c0a281-2
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.920
local talent.

472500d8-577e-437d-95e4-63b429112a65-0
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.720
Our talent is quite raw,
if I may say that.

6474470e-807b-490f-9947-1353dea3e39e-0
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.139
It's sort of natural talent that has not
really gone through, you know,

6474470e-807b-490f-9947-1353dea3e39e-1
00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.720
intensive training that should be there
because we lack the infrastructure.

579d4594-c5b9-4a52-8717-26f672cc499c-0
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.800
But then we have local programs that are
that being, you know, initiated.

f805e1b6-c6c0-4f2d-8187-a52a879c5f69-0
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.695
We have something like the Talanta Hella
program,

f805e1b6-c6c0-4f2d-8187-a52a879c5f69-1
00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:48.880
which targets young people in at the
grassroot levels.

62ea0881-7a83-44bb-b58a-33d91a946fbd-0
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.160
We have the Kenya Academy of Sports that
has been put up recently.

c7c75c6c-381b-492a-9249-a48de002a9f3-0
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.422
And now we can see there's some level of
understanding that we need to develop our

c7c75c6c-381b-492a-9249-a48de002a9f3-1
00:05:58.422 --> 00:05:58.920
talent.

2edaa95d-02b3-4d64-ae99-fece5d3cd3c6-0
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.600
We don't just tap from the community,
but we need to develop it over time.

02f27a97-a305-4b47-86e6-d5fd73c84e1f-0
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.684
So I'm really honoured to speak towards
development in in Kenya because we've

02f27a97-a305-4b47-86e6-d5fd73c84e1f-1
00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:11.200
seen federations now being registered.

be39cf61-0ce2-45dd-8b6c-199a44965fe5-0
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.266
You have to register the federation
through a myriad of steps that require

be39cf61-0ce2-45dd-8b6c-199a44965fe5-1
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.360
intense scrutiny.

757c7744-61b8-48d7-b5d0-f450452802cd-0
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.920
So that we just have well balanced and
well managed sporting organizations.

502c48e9-dd62-4a3c-8970-b8d2daf1110b-0
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.480
That's in that has been another challenge.

6a03f524-201c-4470-9f8d-6443edf933ea-0
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.681
The leadership right from community level
all the way to, you know,

6a03f524-201c-4470-9f8d-6443edf933ea-1
00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:33.200
structures that can, that can be,
you know, sustainable, right?

2f6f8b49-c2b3-4835-959f-c1b8b1c310a4-0
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.261
So, yeah,
right now you're talking about some of

2f6f8b49-c2b3-4835-959f-c1b8b1c310a4-1
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.600
the challenges, right?

0fa12b67-8e36-4574-8697-e76a7ff0ebdd-0
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.724
In terms of the, the, the specific,
you know, the structure,

0fa12b67-8e36-4574-8697-e76a7ff0ebdd-1
00:06:40.724 --> 00:06:41.800
you know the problem.

14b57e0f-9531-41e6-9856-7a2759cd43b3-0
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.560
You mentioned the talent right now.

cbe954a2-9279-4a3e-a9f4-6e62d7c75ef4-0
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.312
Can you elaborate something about you
know the challenge, you know,

cbe954a2-9279-4a3e-a9f4-6e62d7c75ef4-1
00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:54.134
or opportunities in terms of the
specifically about the training and

cbe954a2-9279-4a3e-a9f4-6e62d7c75ef4-2
00:06:54.134 --> 00:06:57.000
developing of sport professionals, right.

c0bf164f-8f8d-4510-89ed-84c379183ca3-0
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.825
In other words, are people getting,
you know,

c0bf164f-8f8d-4510-89ed-84c379183ca3-1
00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:04.862
the how how does someone wants to work in
sports right in Kenya will get will get

c0bf164f-8f8d-4510-89ed-84c379183ca3-2
00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:08.425
trained, you know,
and what type of training can can they

c0bf164f-8f8d-4510-89ed-84c379183ca3-3
00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:09.040
get there?

3dc6b0b3-5338-4789-a683-b75a80144d96-0
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.067
The very few institutions that do offer
training at that level,

3dc6b0b3-5338-4789-a683-b75a80144d96-1
00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:20.041
especially it comes to real academics
where we talk about principles,

3dc6b0b3-5338-4789-a683-b75a80144d96-2
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:25.796
we talk about abstract thinking and took
critical thoughts in leadership for the

3dc6b0b3-5338-4789-a683-b75a80144d96-3
00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:27.360
sporting destinations.

887ec878-ec04-429f-a642-8798094a294d-0
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:35.148
But now we train the athletes, you know,
we train the the our sportsmen and our

887ec878-ec04-429f-a642-8798094a294d-1
00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:40.720
sports ladies at the pitch,
which is coaching more or less.

cd2bb0ed-6dd5-4f63-b247-09ee8d492f62-0
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.698
But now when it comes to leadership
management, you know,

cd2bb0ed-6dd5-4f63-b247-09ee8d492f62-1
00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:49.225
the functions of coordination,
functions of resource allocations,

cd2bb0ed-6dd5-4f63-b247-09ee8d492f62-2
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:53.273
things that require a background but are
really important,

cd2bb0ed-6dd5-4f63-b247-09ee8d492f62-3
00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:56.839
then we have very few institutions that
offer that.

92058c1b-2878-4f42-a295-82dcabfce229-0
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.730
We have a universities at the university
level and that is only for those who do

92058c1b-2878-4f42-a295-82dcabfce229-1
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.836
physical education and not more,
not most of us go through physical

92058c1b-2878-4f42-a295-82dcabfce229-2
00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:06.440
education.

33378fc5-b022-4d10-9615-7960da1e6e99-0
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.333
We,
we are trainers by virtue of having been

33378fc5-b022-4d10-9615-7960da1e6e99-1
00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:12.080
former players, right.

3e3c185e-d2d7-4f5a-af81-57567c335bc9-0
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:20.121
So there is that gap that comes in
between understanding what is required of

3e3c185e-d2d7-4f5a-af81-57567c335bc9-1
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:24.760
a coach, of a referee, of, you know,
a manager.

6733fa6a-cacd-4a72-8254-d0c3b61c74d5-0
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.000
It requires some really structured
training, right?

4e4fb8b9-2f27-431a-9970-ceaff7b0db4f-0
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.080
And that is 1 area that we can, we can,
can build on.

7eef31ed-7278-4070-9f6b-0fd6a9d2159d-0
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.312
I really think that is a gap that we
really need to plug in as a country and

7eef31ed-7278-4070-9f6b-0fd6a9d2159d-1
00:08:37.312 --> 00:08:39.160
as a as an,
as a continent for that matter.

855900c4-fe81-4818-8b3e-dfcb13131742-0
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.240
Yeah.

94b73738-ee98-4574-8ada-99de6ce12fce-0
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.746
And I, and I guess in that respects,
you know, the asthma, you know,

94b73738-ee98-4574-8ada-99de6ce12fce-1
00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:49.629
probably has to do something with that,
which is, you know,

94b73738-ee98-4574-8ada-99de6ce12fce-2
00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:54.548
inspired in other regional sports
management associations that exist across

94b73738-ee98-4574-8ada-99de6ce12fce-3
00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:57.914
the world in terms of, you know, make it,
you know,

94b73738-ee98-4574-8ada-99de6ce12fce-4
00:08:57.914 --> 00:09:01.280
a sports management education available
for people.

989a11b3-35c9-4bdd-acf5-01f624bf803a-0
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.385
But can you tell us a little bit about
your role as coordinator for

989a11b3-35c9-4bdd-acf5-01f624bf803a-1
00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:09.371
international organizations or
partnerships at the African Sports

989a11b3-35c9-4bdd-acf5-01f624bf803a-2
00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:10.760
Management Association?

4b0e3942-d780-402e-9d8d-2bf3c5ef4925-0
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.080
What does your work involve specifically?

67480227-8f88-450b-8d70-427c8565170d-0
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.400
Yes, So proof.

453a0898-9521-4d97-b457-5772df05d5e8-0
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.680
Allow me to just mention that asthma is
African Sports Management Association.

f91aa3e1-30aa-47a2-a24c-c3a903c9d485-0
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.120
And this means that we are a community of
individuals and memberships.

ee2239cb-fdf3-47d9-b68c-af5a754165fc-0
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.280
So we could be a member through being a
part of an institution.

9bcb2274-1f73-4784-a8d7-10ae6370c0af-0
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.236
For instance,
I'm at the Technical University of Kenya

9bcb2274-1f73-4784-a8d7-10ae6370c0af-1
00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:36.280
and as an academic, I can be a member.

80d16320-ad85-486e-9857-b97de0d12798-0
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.640
I, I know S.L.I.Z., yeah, is part of us,
is a member of ASMA.

7d08da92-49c9-48f5-b423-a8c0d0e7f878-0
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.576
So across the continent we've partnered
and we've worked with people who are

7d08da92-49c9-48f5-b423-a8c0d0e7f878-1
00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:51.640
interested in developing sports in Africa.

d796f756-c9ef-4ed0-832f-24021569117d-0
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.600
Now my role there is to ensure that these
linkages are sustained.

947062e6-3684-4fa1-aeea-08509421daf4-0
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.440
It's just to ensure that we bring in more
people on board.

2c5b25e7-fe0a-4288-ba8a-075343c53e28-0
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.826
I speak about asthma in all the functions
that I visit just so that we understand

2c5b25e7-fe0a-4288-ba8a-075343c53e28-1
00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.680
that we, we cannot work alone.

9655dc63-ede7-45f5-a091-d6c2b5f9665b-0
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.297
We require partnerships, require networks,
and one of them has borne this interview

9655dc63-ede7-45f5-a091-d6c2b5f9665b-1
00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:15.000
because it is through those partnerships.

d04687ab-4497-4f59-b5dd-2aa3a885df1f-0
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.720
And I have had the privilege of being at
Harare.

b6e38a01-56ec-4726-8053-24ad23f8961c-0
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.288
I've visited S.L.I.Z.'s offices,
I've visited the facilities,

b6e38a01-56ec-4726-8053-24ad23f8961c-1
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:26.777
I've been part of the training programs
and I've really gotten a lot of value

b6e38a01-56ec-4726-8053-24ad23f8961c-2
00:10:26.777 --> 00:10:31.554
from that partnership which I've carried
back home and brought in on board so many

b6e38a01-56ec-4726-8053-24ad23f8961c-3
00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:32.359
other members.

69843ddd-ead0-4045-b899-b76399c2c70c-0
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.377
So it's through these linkages that we've
been able to establish some some African

69843ddd-ead0-4045-b899-b76399c2c70c-1
00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:41.640
commonality where we want to say we are
one.

6a07aade-eea5-4a07-85b9-a5f2a7d5334d-0
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.640
The Ubuntu spirit of Africa,
the nuances of Africa is like that.

940643ac-7c29-4d43-ae4f-c8c41c3900e8-0
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.360
We are one.

e91937f3-908d-47ed-bc56-81b26c11f392-0
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.280
It is always 1 spirit.

7de9edbc-c36e-4ada-8ba1-c38d32313cd2-0
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.320
If we decide on one goal,
then we go together.

80ddd8e0-0df7-4a7d-8036-a936bfa9f91e-0
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.680
And so we are trying to achieve that
through asthma, through sleaze.

85a1b74d-6b82-4114-afad-d3d9e3ba8f49-0
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.804
And with the Sports Leadership Institute
of Zimbabwe, we've always,

85a1b74d-6b82-4114-afad-d3d9e3ba8f49-1
00:11:00.804 --> 00:11:04.200
we've also curated the Sports Leadership
Institute of Africa.

eed49a62-f938-4fc0-9e87-5d5d5348f64e-0
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.497
And it's through those networks that now
we are championing grassroots development

eed49a62-f938-4fc0-9e87-5d5d5348f64e-1
00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:12.320
of sport, community sport.

7272efff-c9c4-4a05-924d-d5b773559de7-0
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.455
We want to start it right there where the
talent is and want to inculcate

7272efff-c9c4-4a05-924d-d5b773559de7-1
00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:20.995
leadership skills because I think that is
the gap,

7272efff-c9c4-4a05-924d-d5b773559de7-2
00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:26.269
as I mentioned earlier that we have
envisioned as a, as a, as an institute,

7272efff-c9c4-4a05-924d-d5b773559de7-3
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.560
as an association as well, right?

52962a30-fa19-4e71-abbc-99b9582e69b1-0
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.475
No, that's, that's a, you know,
it's a really, really an important,

52962a30-fa19-4e71-abbc-99b9582e69b1-1
00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:35.072
you know,
aspect that what you're doing connecting,

52962a30-fa19-4e71-abbc-99b9582e69b1-2
00:11:35.072 --> 00:11:37.520
you know, other with other organizations,
right.

d7914bfb-36d7-4d58-b257-2bdace40ed0a-0
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.808
And then probably I that's why you get
connected with this four leadership

d7914bfb-36d7-4d58-b257-2bdace40ed0a-1
00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:42.080
Institute of Zimbabwe, right?

22db358d-f379-41fb-84d9-e66c33e78853-0
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.466
Right now,
one thing that I still it's not totally

22db358d-f379-41fb-84d9-e66c33e78853-1
00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:49.766
clear to me, you know,
when I was reading your,

22db358d-f379-41fb-84d9-e66c33e78853-2
00:11:49.766 --> 00:11:51.760
your your bio and background.

5e567dd5-279e-4846-aef7-131faf506747-0
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.720
You also has a participates in some NGO's
related with climate change.

611bd7eb-922b-4c88-9c96-2459b07b2ed5-0
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.365
Could you you connect, you know,
how is that trilogy, you know,

611bd7eb-922b-4c88-9c96-2459b07b2ed5-1
00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:06.216
climate change, sport development,
you know, agents, you know, and tourism,

611bd7eb-922b-4c88-9c96-2459b07b2ed5-2
00:12:06.216 --> 00:12:06.600
right.

d4846491-5b2c-4cff-a799-6f229e78c84c-0
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.520
Really, you know, or,
or or how do you approach these things?

712ac237-9c77-4525-b037-abcba2eb649d-0
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.280
Yeah, I understand your Prof.

1a12df0a-a13e-400a-9502-a0f4e73a70e5-0
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.200
Let me put this.

c3c44aff-a473-4da5-9a94-9d5cf0afa814-0
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:20.243
I think I'm growing up in the gig economy
where you do a myriad of things and you

c3c44aff-a473-4da5-9a94-9d5cf0afa814-1
00:12:20.243 --> 00:12:26.214
find yourself now cultivating to see how
do they connect and they realize that I

c3c44aff-a473-4da5-9a94-9d5cf0afa814-2
00:12:26.214 --> 00:12:28.720
have a passion for sustainability.

c6b43313-2016-40f4-9844-09e73d1e96e8-0
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.531
It really does not matter in which aspect
whether it's an indication as an

c6b43313-2016-40f4-9844-09e73d1e96e8-1
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:33.040
indicator.

8ba89128-90ae-4c36-93ce-2a24f8f6a0a4-0
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.979
I want to see how sustainable principle
can can be embedded into it and this has

8ba89128-90ae-4c36-93ce-2a24f8f6a0a4-1
00:12:38.979 --> 00:12:40.920
taken me to spaces in sports.

ba963b21-ff6a-452d-ad5c-db26623a7528-0
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.720
I want to see how do we sustain these
aspects.

e3407546-3cfe-47a3-9421-9d41864c7871-0
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.578
We want our children to enjoy the the
goodness of Mother Nature that we've

e3407546-3cfe-47a3-9421-9d41864c7871-1
00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:50.680
earned over time.

81f32029-f196-4962-8d4b-3abac0a296a4-0
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.400
The spirit of Africa is in our soil.

f8deeaac-99fa-467f-bf9a-8bedda7372d4-0
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.120
It is in our.

74adaae5-c47e-4484-b20c-06e6921d9995-0
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.240
It's in nature.

1b89940d-cbfc-489c-8395-eef2a982f2fd-0
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.320
It's embedded in the relationship we have
with nature, flora, fauna.

65d9394a-c62e-4a08-846b-a35038805d05-0
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.880
And we can see the effects of climate
change.

0be19546-aceb-4c72-bba3-bbd7c01c6a74-0
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.240
And this has affected vulnerable groups.

6fa97274-7a9a-4d16-ad53-4d264f244d91-0
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.960
I speak for women in our communities.

ac3a6931-caa9-4af8-85dd-1234e2301823-0
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.760
They want to participate in sport.

878df8f3-107a-4828-b085-2e363a610572-0
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.030
But because of reality,
the reality is have on the ground on

878df8f3-107a-4828-b085-2e363a610572-1
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.600
issues to do with this appropriation of
resources.

64198a52-bb30-4773-864a-fd144dbeba99-0
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.005
Yeah,
sometimes even the ownership of resources

64198a52-bb30-4773-864a-fd144dbeba99-1
00:13:24.005 --> 00:13:24.640
is skewed.

801c13ee-7659-41ee-a56c-ce1d720cf206-0
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.571
But now we are saying how can we talk
about development without inclusivity,

801c13ee-7659-41ee-a56c-ce1d720cf206-1
00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:32.200
without sustainability.

435a79a8-4eee-4c9a-9dda-600caa162a3a-0
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.697
So I talk,
I speak to my youth because our NGO is in

435a79a8-4eee-4c9a-9dda-600caa162a3a-1
00:13:36.697 --> 00:13:42.032
rehabilitation of it's called Transfer
Green World and we are in the

435a79a8-4eee-4c9a-9dda-600caa162a3a-2
00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:44.120
rehabilitation of wetlands.

16413d72-d833-4a70-bf3a-9c0b766a3e7f-0
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.720
We have reforested about 2000 acres in
the FAR in the last three years.

22f462ef-fc74-457e-a241-7b2df8930e6f-0
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.798
In our communities,
we we talked to the young people,

22f462ef-fc74-457e-a241-7b2df8930e6f-1
00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:57.560
we talked to the women,
we talked to groups of communities and we

22f462ef-fc74-457e-a241-7b2df8930e6f-2
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.064
encourage them to participate in smart
agriculture and in those functions they

22f462ef-fc74-457e-a241-7b2df8930e6f-3
00:14:02.064 --> 00:14:06.567
also participate in sport and sport has
been a very big vehicle in getting the

22f462ef-fc74-457e-a241-7b2df8930e6f-4
00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:07.479
the message out.

93e295cc-7805-4bb4-a585-d6de6a91185c-0
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.760
Remember I said I've grown up in a
community of athletes.

614114b2-4636-4b7e-9cc0-2e85f9cf9023-0
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.526
So when we have a marathon,
we have a community work and we talk

614114b2-4636-4b7e-9cc0-2e85f9cf9023-1
00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:17.443
about sustainability,
talk about reforestation, it,

614114b2-4636-4b7e-9cc0-2e85f9cf9023-2
00:14:17.443 --> 00:14:20.080
it brings a different connection all
together.

b4e226d1-f643-4a4c-aff2-b57ac7e867f5-0
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.304
And the youth now see the value of sport
beyond the field beyond,

b4e226d1-f643-4a4c-aff2-b57ac7e867f5-1
00:14:24.304 --> 00:14:29.552
and they see other opportunities also for
entrepreneurship that I don't need just

b4e226d1-f643-4a4c-aff2-b57ac7e867f5-2
00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:30.640
to be an athlete.

cb2acd60-0f0e-47fa-ac69-cec72aed53d3-0
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.680
I can be something else within the
sporting industry.

2a441662-dd00-4ff0-8bba-1b4051b3da8e-0
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.640
Yeah, right.

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-0
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.145
Now this is, I mean,
this is very interesting because as you

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-1
00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:43.270
mentioned, you know,
sustainability is actually is,

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-2
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:48.257
is one of the pillars not only from the
United Nations, right, but also, you know,

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-3
00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:51.262
it's today within the Olympic movement,
you know,

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-4
00:14:51.262 --> 00:14:56.310
as we need to really put attention right
to sustainable, you know, the environment,

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-5
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.975
right, which is, as you know,
is critical for for people who

4649b706-ece0-4d2a-8408-464c8c94dbcf-6
00:14:59.975 --> 00:15:02.800
participate in sports and also tourism,
right.

f2ee0074-1a0c-4ad9-a6d3-fe8abc50f0d7-0
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.600
So these things are not,
are not disconnected.

503f5386-f3ac-44f3-86fc-48356662a8cd-0
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.240
Yeah, very, very interesting.

fedbfe70-da2a-470f-9141-c77a46733487-0
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.937
Now,
the last question that I have for you is

fedbfe70-da2a-470f-9141-c77a46733487-1
00:15:09.937 --> 00:15:12.217
A and,
and actually this is two different

fedbfe70-da2a-470f-9141-c77a46733487-2
00:15:12.217 --> 00:15:12.760
questions.

5d4c5bfe-c011-425d-b09b-e5a086183cf0-0
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.535
You know, when in one,
One is that in terms of the, the, the,

5d4c5bfe-c011-425d-b09b-e5a086183cf0-1
00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:20.980
the challenges, you know, of what,
what are the challenges that you see,

5d4c5bfe-c011-425d-b09b-e5a086183cf0-2
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.000
you know, in terms of, you know,
the sport development in Africa?

4c1be693-3bca-4e95-805d-06496dcb6e0a-0
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.338
You know, if from, from your,
from your experience, from your angle,

4c1be693-3bca-4e95-805d-06496dcb6e0a-1
00:15:29.338 --> 00:15:33.740
you know, as an educator, what can you,
if you can tell us, you know,

4c1be693-3bca-4e95-805d-06496dcb6e0a-2
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.947
what are the challenge that you see that
you know,

4c1be693-3bca-4e95-805d-06496dcb6e0a-3
00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:39.840
sport development Africa has no moving
ahead.

9ed847b4-9824-47c2-9f30-4079e9cd80d6-0
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.060
I'll take that as well in two ways,
Prof First,

9ed847b4-9824-47c2-9f30-4079e9cd80d6-1
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.120
I'll start say that what's our,
our priorities?

81b951b3-af9a-4365-9bb2-effae06c3f83-0
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.320
I'll take that differently.

89be36a3-4409-4608-a29f-3acf517b432d-0
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:56.332
What is the priority we have as a
continent and some of the key issues that

89be36a3-4409-4608-a29f-3acf517b432d-1
00:15:56.332 --> 00:16:03.990
come to me is we do not have professional
management of sports and that has really

89be36a3-4409-4608-a29f-3acf517b432d-2
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.880
hindered how we restructured our sports
environment.

8832f2c5-dd73-4b50-bb95-c4987b0efb41-0
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.324
We have made sports to be more of a
participation event and after the

8832f2c5-dd73-4b50-bb95-c4987b0efb41-1
00:16:15.324 --> 00:16:17.480
participation, we go home.

3583c18f-d795-477c-aa62-880aefb6248b-0
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.760
We've seen stadia lying vacant for years
because, you know,

3583c18f-d795-477c-aa62-880aefb6248b-1
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.640
there was one world championship and none
other after that.

cb4ea09f-f5d0-46e6-ad4d-df84ce0a2f0e-0
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.760
Then that we don't know what to do with
it and they become white elephants.

3303be84-50d2-4da5-8a03-e09f42f7973c-0
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.876
So if you can prioritize killing
structure, dedication, curriculum that,

3303be84-50d2-4da5-8a03-e09f42f7973c-1
00:16:35.876 --> 00:16:39.200
you know,
speak to the specific needs of

3303be84-50d2-4da5-8a03-e09f42f7973c-2
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.144
communities because not everybody will
want to go run truck,

3303be84-50d2-4da5-8a03-e09f42f7973c-3
00:16:44.144 --> 00:16:48.440
not everybody will have the talent to
play football.

d3484945-910f-4561-8c11-e9782bd0dd40-0
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.473
But if the opportunity is there to
participate in physical education,

d3484945-910f-4561-8c11-e9782bd0dd40-1
00:16:52.473 --> 00:16:55.338
the structure,
there's a field for me to just go run,

d3484945-910f-4561-8c11-e9782bd0dd40-2
00:16:55.338 --> 00:16:56.240
you know, to jog.

aea0ca3d-d76f-41ab-bbd4-215df7ee8576-0
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.880
It would make a difference.

108147a3-e792-463c-8844-ba1401b51256-0
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.854
And then then we have now the education
programs that come in at the community

108147a3-e792-463c-8844-ba1401b51256-1
00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:01.080
level.

f675ea1d-bcb6-4bf6-a03a-666bf122a0fe-0
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.320
We have also talked about expanding
inclusivity.

83e54a32-c687-4309-949d-7050c74dae55-0
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:10.322
It has become almost given that most
sport is played by one gender,

83e54a32-c687-4309-949d-7050c74dae55-1
00:17:10.322 --> 00:17:16.147
the other gender tends to be sort of,
you know, they, we, oh, oh,

83e54a32-c687-4309-949d-7050c74dae55-2
00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:17.560
they were there.

38a6bda0-94ab-43e1-8a57-ebd7767a0cac-0
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.489
Let's let's add this, you know,
a female version of this and such like

38a6bda0-94ab-43e1-8a57-ebd7767a0cac-1
00:17:22.489 --> 00:17:22.960
things.

10d3ac39-73d8-489f-89eb-f3be1511b4dc-0
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.453
So creating pathways for youthful women
to be part of the leadership of sports

10d3ac39-73d8-489f-89eb-f3be1511b4dc-1
00:17:27.453 --> 00:17:29.160
management would be brilliant.

0731e95f-8eeb-4202-8408-d58c5cffc9b2-0
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.120
Yes.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.800
Perfect, perfect.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.400
Now in, in, in, in, in, in.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.640
Now, from the perspective of ASMA you know,

0d865137-12ec-4733-8c05-eb95ebc43bff-1
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.776
and your role and what do you think are,
you know, what is,

0d865137-12ec-4733-8c05-eb95ebc43bff-2
00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:43.120
what would you like to accomplish?

ecbf3908-f53c-4e80-89bc-0fb3ce0369d6-0
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.132
You know,
in terms of and what do you think our

ecbf3908-f53c-4e80-89bc-0fb3ce0369d6-1
00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:50.400
ASMA should be actually putting attention in terms of priorities,

ecbf3908-f53c-4e80-89bc-0fb3ce0369d6-2
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.920
you know, so your, your, your wishes,
you know, your, your, your goals.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.600
What would you would you like to
accomplish through asthma?

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.896
And what do you see that ASMA should be putting attention, right, in terms of,

5f6e0ad3-f962-49df-99e0-fe8478df00bc-1
00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:03.800
you know, opportunities or challenges?

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.773
Two things come to mind,
Prof that I'm passionate about close

df983405-3b64-42b8-b4d9-f4c0419a097a-1
00:18:08.773 --> 00:18:09.680
collaboration.

fd0fa900-e825-4aa3-9812-85158a1e2aa7-0
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.947
It does not matter in what aspect,
whether it's leadership or there's in

fd0fa900-e825-4aa3-9812-85158a1e2aa7-1
00:18:13.947 --> 00:18:15.960
participation, we need to collaborate.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.575
We need to sit down and understand what
are your strengths, what are mine,

605d4ff8-da5e-4147-ac03-4842b369df2a-1
00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:22.360
where can we help each other.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.800
And I think if we have that one purpose
of mind, we'll achieve a lot.

e7ef91cc-715a-424e-8f9e-0e84e24d7d06-0
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.480
Secondly, technology.

654f40a5-9a10-467b-b8b1-a5515d8f75e0-0
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.160
We cannot run away from that.

Let's utilize those tools through
technology that you can reach as many

41ec02c3-1f49-4c3a-8fe1-4627150182c7-1
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:48.686
people learn through programs like this
online AI is the is a venture that we can
