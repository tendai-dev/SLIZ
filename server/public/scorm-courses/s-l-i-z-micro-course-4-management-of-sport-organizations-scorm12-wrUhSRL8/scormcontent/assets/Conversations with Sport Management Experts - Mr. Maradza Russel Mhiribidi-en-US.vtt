01ddd7e1-f6ee-47af-8b41-c78c89282cca-1
00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:29.856
about the challenges and opportunities
facing the sport management across the

01ddd7e1-f6ee-47af-8b41-c78c89282cca-2
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:30.440
continent.

70f29ea7-6bdd-42b4-8e10-3e31ae4872bc-0
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.560
OK, so let's let's begin.

22487a25-d96a-41ac-99a5-5dd3597ef34b-0
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.280
So could you share a bit about your
personal and professional background?

34051e48-bec3-45b4-921e-d45be839a838-0
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.836
OK,
What inspired you to create the Sport

34051e48-bec3-45b4-921e-d45be839a838-1
00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:48.045
Leadership Institute of Zimbabwe and what
are some of the projects you are

34051e48-bec3-45b4-921e-d45be839a838-2
00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:49.280
currently involved in?

894ed1ad-bc9a-46eb-9d93-8b73610631eb-0
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.160
Oh, thank you very much,
Professor Gonzalo.

969af77b-8a1b-453d-8696-0963bb2aeefb-0
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.560
It's always a pleasure to talk to you
about sports management globally.

04ada7c2-b520-459a-aaec-f04c3cecf87c-0
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.594
To begin with,
let me just start by saying I started

04ada7c2-b520-459a-aaec-f04c3cecf87c-1
00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:08.520
being involved in sport at school level
prime both primary and high school.

ed0ec9ce-ac46-4eb2-974a-3bc08d199f4d-0
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.067
And I started being more involved and I
was exposed to proper coaching at high

ed0ec9ce-ac46-4eb2-974a-3bc08d199f4d-1
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:18.400
school where I did a lot of track and
field in terms of athletics.

a7a3f197-bfd2-4970-969c-7b5e2783e0a7-0
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.840
And then I played a lot of basketball and
and rugby.

70fef98c-cd17-44dc-8cbe-d5bf3a3de398-0
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.984
And my major sport then after high school
was basketball which I played at all

70fef98c-cd17-44dc-8cbe-d5bf3a3de398-1
00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:33.840
levels in our country.

da7fdf5e-c955-41bf-b9a9-de06527f7d89-0
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:43.840
And I also managed to coach and manage
the national teams I then went to.

4de02d75-f5f6-441d-bada-8b12a99b3246-0
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.940
For my education, I did the diploma,
University of Zimbabwe Diploma in

4de02d75-f5f6-441d-bada-8b12a99b3246-1
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.400
Physical Education and Sports where I was
trained to teach in high schools.

1dd10d50-3fd5-4491-b721-05a3ef2be1ae-0
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.453
I taught there for a couple of years and
then advanced my education with a

1dd10d50-3fd5-4491-b721-05a3ef2be1ae-1
00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:05.200
bachelor's degree in physical education
and sports and Sports Science.

a2f33e65-6dfc-4903-a6c9-fa1afa568715-0
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.636
That is when I then after completion of
that,

a2f33e65-6dfc-4903-a6c9-fa1afa568715-1
00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:13.120
I joined the Sports and Recreation
Commission of Zimbabwe,

a2f33e65-6dfc-4903-a6c9-fa1afa568715-2
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.548
which is the supreme governing board of
sports in Zimbabwe where I went as

a2f33e65-6dfc-4903-a6c9-fa1afa568715-3
00:03:17.548 --> 00:03:21.800
provisional manager right up to regional
manager and regional director.

82d40750-337c-4d26-a2bc-b17823fa0bfb-0
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.083
I then left the Sports and Recreation
Commission and then started the Sports

82d40750-337c-4d26-a2bc-b17823fa0bfb-1
00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:36.840
Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe and that
was in 2008.

9370a70f-aa42-4790-add6-da8fbb592e84-0
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.400
That's when we started the Sports and
Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe.

78cd8655-f1ef-41f0-83e3-fae6d70892c1-0
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.269
What made us start the Sports Leaders
Institute of Zimbabwe was the fact that

78cd8655-f1ef-41f0-83e3-fae6d70892c1-1
00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.749
we we realized that there was a gap when
it came to the career development pathway

78cd8655-f1ef-41f0-83e3-fae6d70892c1-2
00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:59.163
of the sports administrator as opposed to
the technical official where everything

78cd8655-f1ef-41f0-83e3-fae6d70892c1-3
00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:04.577
is clearly laid out like a piece of cake
by the international federations when it

78cd8655-f1ef-41f0-83e3-fae6d70892c1-4
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.359
comes to sports management.

179a4a2f-cf7c-40b5-8832-b2c5fcf348d6-0
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.480
It was neglected especially in Zimbabwe
and the continent of Africa.

0ab2777a-d399-4a1d-a364-b3308a53d7d0-0
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.841
So we saw a gap and that saw the best of
the Sports Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe

0ab2777a-d399-4a1d-a364-b3308a53d7d0-1
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:22.848
where we decided that we could come up
with programs that would enhance and make

0ab2777a-d399-4a1d-a364-b3308a53d7d0-2
00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:27.371
our sports managers,
sports administrators as more efficient

0ab2777a-d399-4a1d-a364-b3308a53d7d0-3
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.080
in terms of running sport in Zimbabwe,
in Africa.

ea3459df-3973-4e24-9fa8-33b458415057-0
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.800
Excellent, excellent.

c3e84487-9136-4cac-92e9-a8b8b2c0b156-0
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.824
So I mean, you,
you have mentioned about that there,

c3e84487-9136-4cac-92e9-a8b8b2c0b156-1
00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:43.203
there is a gap right, in terms of the,
the, the, the preparations,

c3e84487-9136-4cac-92e9-a8b8b2c0b156-2
00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:48.040
the training of a sport, you know,
managers or people who will be running

c3e84487-9136-4cac-92e9-a8b8b2c0b156-3
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.419
sports organizations, clubs, you know,
and and so forth, you know,

c3e84487-9136-4cac-92e9-a8b8b2c0b156-4
00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.400
in the country.

0f19a5d2-1244-4707-84a9-9ed8fd3ed17d-0
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.509
So based on your experience with the
Sport Leadership Institute of Zimbabwe,

0f19a5d2-1244-4707-84a9-9ed8fd3ed17d-1
00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.794
what skills,
knowledge or type of experience are most

0f19a5d2-1244-4707-84a9-9ed8fd3ed17d-2
00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:08.000
lacking among sports professional in
Zimbabwe today?

cfe70ce2-63de-4b94-9808-c6625892cc1f-0
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.600
Where do you see the greatest need for
capacity building?

3060c669-52d0-4a9f-a4c0-7c1315c8144e-0
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.268
I think with the with our existence for
more than 10 years ago,

3060c669-52d0-4a9f-a4c0-7c1315c8144e-1
00:05:18.268 --> 00:05:20.480
the landscape has changed a little bit.

53f65c09-5547-4656-9379-a59952f91436-0
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.627
But in the beginning, there was a lot,
lot of games when it came to issues to do

53f65c09-5547-4656-9379-a59952f91436-1
00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:33.858
with planning,
organizing and managing sport clubs,

53f65c09-5547-4656-9379-a59952f91436-2
00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:37.480
sport federations in managing teams.

df51f010-d0cc-4703-a6b5-dc9abeb0e42c-0
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.971
So we we,
we felt that we could come in and close

df51f010-d0cc-4703-a6b5-dc9abeb0e42c-1
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:45.809
that gap by way of running the short
courses,

df51f010-d0cc-4703-a6b5-dc9abeb0e42c-2
00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:52.233
short sports management camps where we
sports leaders from across the divide

df51f010-d0cc-4703-a6b5-dc9abeb0e42c-3
00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:58.406
would come and learn in a very relaxed
atmosphere where they would not be

df51f010-d0cc-4703-a6b5-dc9abeb0e42c-4
00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:04.497
subjected to rigorous examinations,
but just being reminded of the basic

df51f010-d0cc-4703-a6b5-dc9abeb0e42c-5
00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:07.000
fundamentals of running sport.

da234876-c48d-4eba-8c89-3fbd268f5e25-0
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.560
So yeah, that that is what we saw.

cff2b76d-81e7-46e6-8596-d9cfc9dff778-0
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.800
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

6504d42c-444e-4311-9b28-f93ec9046126-0
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.842
Let me just turn a little bit, you know,
the the conversation now and talk a

6504d42c-444e-4311-9b28-f93ec9046126-1
00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:20.270
little bit about the challenges, you know,
in the region, you know,

6504d42c-444e-4311-9b28-f93ec9046126-2
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.800
the sports systems across Africa face a
variety of challenges, right?

842391b7-490b-48ea-adbd-dd94e4d3f652-0
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.541
From your perspective,
what are some of the most pressing issues

842391b7-490b-48ea-adbd-dd94e4d3f652-1
00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:31.917
affecting the development of the sports
not only in Zimbabwe but across the

842391b7-490b-48ea-adbd-dd94e4d3f652-2
00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:32.320
region?

133ad71a-b177-4494-9b48-edd907f17139-0
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.990
I think one of the worst things that I've
realized in my country and across the

133ad71a-b177-4494-9b48-edd907f17139-1
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.556
continent is that our sports leaders and
our sports teams and everyone in sports,

133ad71a-b177-4494-9b48-edd907f17139-2
00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:49.240
they want to do well in sport,
but they don't want to do sport well.

4ca604ea-b8fd-4524-b1e1-4748662f7ed6-0
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.600
And by that I mean,
that's a great way to to say it.

679ee905-4c36-4bed-aa03-03fab8548223-0
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.840
Yeah, yes.

50b86956-18ef-4e01-8fa7-1bd468c47e68-0
00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.132
They don't want to do it well because
they don't want to apply the right basic

50b86956-18ef-4e01-8fa7-1bd468c47e68-1
00:07:00.132 --> 00:07:04.219
fundamentals of running sports in terms
of sport management,

50b86956-18ef-4e01-8fa7-1bd468c47e68-2
00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:09.176
which is obviously if you look at the
cycle where you deal with planning,

50b86956-18ef-4e01-8fa7-1bd468c47e68-3
00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:12.794
organizing, controlling,
implementing and evaluation,

50b86956-18ef-4e01-8fa7-1bd468c47e68-4
00:07:12.794 --> 00:07:16.680
they would rather control in the system
so that they win.

0dd558e2-6c84-4742-bef3-b9879df63ebc-0
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.200
The winning is what they look for.

89870df5-4fd6-4fe1-8b23-5a424a049cfb-0
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.946
They're not looking at the right basic
growth, organic growth of the athlete,

89870df5-4fd6-4fe1-8b23-5a424a049cfb-1
00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:30.760
basic organic growth of the sports
management ecosystem.

c13577ce-5438-4011-9616-97139e49ee5e-0
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.877
So that is a challenge when people are
more into the way,

c13577ce-5438-4011-9616-97139e49ee5e-1
00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:40.158
people are more interested in titles
other than the work that they're supposed

c13577ce-5438-4011-9616-97139e49ee5e-2
00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:40.560
to do.

8b4cf1bf-0ad9-428b-a90a-da1ec75f0892-0
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.991
So we believe that the African sports
leader needs a lot more knowledge so that

8b4cf1bf-0ad9-428b-a90a-da1ec75f0892-1
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:51.040
they become knowledgeable about what they
are doing.

2ee6b0e2-f916-4044-8d12-0749e55a22d5-0
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.647
And once we do that,
I believe we will write,

2ee6b0e2-f916-4044-8d12-0749e55a22d5-1
00:07:53.647 --> 00:07:56.880
we will strike the record like we are
beginning to do right now.

cc01cfa7-837d-4b7a-8be4-e9916482584e-0
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.232
I think we are very happy and it's all
thanks to efforts from organizers like

cc01cfa7-837d-4b7a-8be4-e9916482584e-1
00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:05.480
the Sports Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe,
the Africa Sports Management Association

cc01cfa7-837d-4b7a-8be4-e9916482584e-2
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.267
in various Olympic and sport movements
that have now put education at the

cc01cfa7-837d-4b7a-8be4-e9916482584e-3
00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:13.054
forefront so that people are able to
understand the product that they are

cc01cfa7-837d-4b7a-8be4-e9916482584e-4
00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:13.720
dealing with.

b042508f-dd98-4716-8051-f8be382d14f5-0
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.520
Perfect, perfect.

10553049-4d5f-4210-bcd3-eff53a06d27f-0
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.151
Let's talk a little bit about strategic
partnerships,

10553049-4d5f-4210-bcd3-eff53a06d27f-1
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:23.280
right so partnerships often play a
critical role in advancing sport.

21a5b662-2828-43e1-a4f0-f2b125939b4f-0
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.104
What roles do partnerships whether this
is our private sector,

21a5b662-2828-43e1-a4f0-f2b125939b4f-1
00:08:28.104 --> 00:08:32.794
governments or international
organizations play in the strategic

21a5b662-2828-43e1-a4f0-f2b125939b4f-2
00:08:32.794 --> 00:08:38.204
planning and developing of the sport
Leaders is Institute of Zimbabwe is a

21a5b662-2828-43e1-a4f0-f2b125939b4f-3
00:08:38.204 --> 00:08:43.543
sports leadership of Zimbabwe don't
operate in a vacuum and neither if we

21a5b662-2828-43e1-a4f0-f2b125939b4f-4
00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:48.015
reinvented anything,
we are just there to refine once already

21a5b662-2828-43e1-a4f0-f2b125939b4f-5
00:08:48.015 --> 00:08:52.200
existing and add a little bit of what we
can add to that.

08f079e1-23b1-4dd8-8d9e-d456ce5b94b7-0
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.983
And as you everyone is aware in any
country there are laws of the land that

08f079e1-23b1-4dd8-8d9e-d456ce5b94b7-1
00:08:57.983 --> 00:08:59.240
one must apply to.

af953f43-bbff-4533-acad-a17e548d57b6-0
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:07.692
So it's entails that we engage with
government ministry like we are a private

af953f43-bbff-4533-acad-a17e548d57b6-1
00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:15.080
NGO operating within the national sports
development policy of Zimbabwe.

70839ed1-09be-4bcf-ac2b-a621336c0810-0
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.428
So it is very important that we create
this strategic partnerships that we

70839ed1-09be-4bcf-ac2b-a621336c0810-1
00:09:19.428 --> 00:09:23.546
understand and appreciate the different
roles that the private sector,

70839ed1-09be-4bcf-ac2b-a621336c0810-2
00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:26.851
the government,
the local authorities and of course even

70839ed1-09be-4bcf-ac2b-a621336c0810-3
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.968
the educational institutions like
colleges and universities that offer

70839ed1-09be-4bcf-ac2b-a621336c0810-4
00:09:30.968 --> 00:09:32.360
sporting education play.

6b6de9cd-5ae8-44fb-8904-6396aac95bb3-0
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.236
So that at the end of the day will not
abuse very little resource that we have

6b6de9cd-5ae8-44fb-8904-6396aac95bb3-1
00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:43.802
in terms of applying and using what we
already have in terms when it comes to

6b6de9cd-5ae8-44fb-8904-6396aac95bb3-2
00:09:43.802 --> 00:09:45.800
sport development education.

8418a161-c53b-4cad-8d0f-c89616b99d15-0
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.363
So it's very important from a slit
perspective that we all work together and

8418a161-c53b-4cad-8d0f-c89616b99d15-1
00:09:52.363 --> 00:09:58.440
remember sport is always been and will
always be a team issue and effort.

def2c458-62ad-4f3f-897b-c7bf3a283a93-0
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.800
Right?

7b670c0d-7361-4bed-908b-4b034b6ee65a-0
00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.800
No, Excellent.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.360
So let's talk a little bit about the
future, right?

fee9716d-4966-4640-b3e1-1ad4830e22b8-0
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.467
Looking ahead,
what are the top priorities for the Sport

fee9716d-4966-4640-b3e1-1ad4830e22b8-1
00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:08.520
Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe over the
next five years?

27bf20e2-1a84-4095-bdcc-1dea0eff8808-0
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.452
Where do you see the greatest
opportunities for growth and innovation

27bf20e2-1a84-4095-bdcc-1dea0eff8808-1
00:10:13.452 --> 00:10:16.520
is the Sports Leaders Institute of
Zimbabwe?

b1113f23-bded-4832-bfb6-78222994be49-0
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.029
We see with what has been happening,
the partnerships that we've created,

b1113f23-bded-4832-bfb6-78222994be49-1
00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:25.600
especially the one with West Virginia
University that we're talking about.

46530716-04de-4ddd-b285-fb2d764a1ae5-0
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.297
We are looking at creating a group global
sports leader who's able to exist and

46530716-04de-4ddd-b285-fb2d764a1ae5-1
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:36.567
operate effectively and efficiently
within the global sporting management

46530716-04de-4ddd-b285-fb2d764a1ae5-2
00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:37.280
landscape.

5d8b707a-3b7f-4510-8b07-20d033e4ee3b-0
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.280
And we are very excited that we are in
the right direction.

8a1b48d7-fa97-4e3d-a54f-3611495687ea-0
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.879
And with this program that is coming up,
we certainly believe that this is going

8a1b48d7-fa97-4e3d-a54f-3611495687ea-1
00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:53.409
to be a game changer that is going to
make everyone confident because where you

8a1b48d7-fa97-4e3d-a54f-3611495687ea-2
00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:55.760
have knowledge, you are confident.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:58.960
Mr.

8088ed31-2eff-44b8-96e3-d518a0eae67c-0
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.010
Mhiribidi,
thank you very much for your thoughtful

8088ed31-2eff-44b8-96e3-d518a0eae67c-1
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.600
reflections and for sharing your
experiences with us today.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.737
Your insights offer a valuable
perspective on the management of sport in

cc67cc77-b36d-46fd-80c7-9d79dc832936-1
00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:12.880
Zimbabwe and across the African continent
more broadly.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.832
To our participants,
I hope this conversations has deepened

eb5dd193-1d02-42e2-b083-4a405f5ec598-1
00:11:16.832 --> 00:11:21.106
your understanding of how national sport
institutions operate, you know,

eb5dd193-1d02-42e2-b083-4a405f5ec598-2
00:11:21.106 --> 00:11:25.614
and the challenges that faces, you know,
not only organizations in Zimbabwe,

eb5dd193-1d02-42e2-b083-4a405f5ec598-3
00:11:25.614 --> 00:11:29.244
but across the regions, you know,
and the kind of leadership,

eb5dd193-1d02-42e2-b083-4a405f5ec598-4
00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:33.634
collaborations and innovation required to
advance sport systems, you know,

eb5dd193-1d02-42e2-b083-4a405f5ec598-5
00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:35.040
in complex environments.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.320
Once again, Mr.

079113a3-7e1b-4e8b-a61a-f99416658169-0
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.961
Mhiribidi ,
thank you for your time and for being

079113a3-7e1b-4e8b-a61a-f99416658169-1
00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:40.440
part of this important dial.

Thank you.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.186
And I'd left one thing,
Prof I also looking at in terms of

154eaad5-216c-48bf-8af7-f808ef526d2b-1
00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:46.960
innovation.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.533
We also looking at at the Zimbabwean and
African sports leader using AI for more

1e1182a7-2fa9-48cc-9537-074ff6508cc0-1
00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:57.240
informed business insights and decision
making.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:03.620
And we want to use the digital space a
little bit more so that we all work in

d0089291-013c-40f3-a7c5-332af0fd645a-1
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.640
tandem with the Global Rd.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.396
Remember,
the road has become one global village

14ea00af-951a-4096-8238-0f32831198d9-1
00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:09.240
because of AII.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.440
Thank you very much for having me here
and all the place.

Thank you.
